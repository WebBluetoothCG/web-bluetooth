# Rationale for Web Bluetooth design decisions

This document attempts to explain why various decisions were made the way they were.

## Why only BTLE, Central, and Client?

* The key/value structure of GATT is believed to reduce the risk of device exploits
  compared to the unstructured byte-stream of other protocols.
  When the <i>Characteristic Aggregate Format</i> and <i>Characteristic Presentation Format</i>
  <a title="Descriptor">Descriptors</a> are provided for a <a>Characteristic</a>,
  the UA can further validate any data passed to the device.

* Energy usage is becoming more important, especially on mobile devices,
  and the BTLE spec is significantly more optimized for this concern.

* Future devices are increasingly likely to support BTLE,
  so supporting that in the first version of the web API provides more long-term reach
  than supporting Bluetooth Classic first.
  The disadvantage of this choice is that fewer current devices and operating systems support BTLE.

* While devices that run web browsers can benefit from <a>Peripheral</a> support,
  more use cases require <a>Central</a> support.

* While the <a>Server</a> role can work in a <a>Central</a> device,
  <a>Client</a> is more natural and is required for more use cases.

## Why does `requestDevice()` require non-empty filters?

In order to communicate with a device, that device needs to support a GATT
Service that the web page understands and has permission to access. If the web
page doesn't filter the devices that appear in the `requestDevice()` dialog,
users could easily select a device the web page can't use, which is a bad
experience.

One reason for scanning without service UUID filters is to collect just
advertising data from several nearby devices. The first version of Web Bluetooth
is aimed at GATT communication with particular paired devices and doesn't
support this use case. A subsequent version will most likely include such
support, likely through a different entry point.

## Why so many `Get{,All}{Service,Characteristic,Descriptor}()` overloads?

GATT provides two ways of finding primary services:
_Discover All Primary Services_ and _Discover Primary Service by Service UUID_.
Each can be stopped early if the desired service is found.
_Discover All Primary Services_ encodes the result more efficiently:
each response packet can include multiple services,
while the _by Service UUID_ variant only returns one service per packet.
Although we don't want to require UAs to do anything
beyond discovering all services on connection,
we'd like to allow them to optimize their use of the radio.

* The fact that the procedures can stop early means
  it could help to declare that a call only needs one result.
* The _by Service UUID_ variant means it could help to accept a single UUID argument.
* Developers also need to be able to get access to all instances of a single UUID,
  for example to retrieve the services describing several batteries in a device.

This covers `Promise<Service> getService(UUID)`,
`Promise<Service> getAnyService(sequence<UUID>)`,
`Promise<sequence<Service>> getAllServices(UUID)`, and
`Promise<sequence<Service>> getAllServices()`.
(We currently omit `Promise<Service> getAnyService(sequence<UUID>)`
to keep the API a bit smaller.)

If a developer wants to interact with a set of services,
the above set of functions makes them choose between calling `getService(UUID)` several times,
or calling `getAllServices()` and filtering out the results they're not interested in.
Calling `getService(UUID)` several times may cause the UA to waste round trips
given the less efficient encoding of the response to _Discover Primary Service by Service UUID_.
So we offer `Promise<sequence<Service>> getAllServices(sequence<UUID>)`
to let the developer express their goals up front, so the UA can optimize appropriately.

Only services and characteristics offer the _by UUID_ procedure,
but we offer the full set of overloads for included services and descriptors as well
so that the API doesn't have unexpected gaps.

## Why does `getAllServices()` return only primary services?

GATT allows a service to be either "primary" or "secondary" and
allows the _Read By Group Type Request_ to ask for an enumeration of either (3.G.2.5.3).
However, all secondary services are also included services in some primary service (1.A.6.5.1),
and having `getAllServices()` include them would cost an extra request sequence.

The current API does give UAs the freedom to scan for secondary services eagerly.

## When a device supports both Notification and Indication, why not give the site control of which to use?

The [Mac API](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/CBPeripheral_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011289-CH1-SW6)
defaults to Notification,
and the [Android API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothGatt.html#setCharacteristicNotification%28android.bluetooth.BluetoothGattCharacteristic, boolean%29)
doesn't document which it prefers when both are available.
Neither gives enough control to
implement a web standard that gives the web page the ability to choose.

## Why do we have just one connection instead of one per call to connectGATT()?

If each call to `BluetoothDevice.connectGATT()` returned a separate `BluetoothGATTRemoteServer` instance,
which could be disconnected independently of other concurrent instances,
then components of a page could do their own lifecycle management,
disconnecting when they were finished with a device.
This implies separate Service, Characteristic, and Descriptor instances for each connection because
we'd want _some_ way to get a `BluetoothGATTRemoteServer` instance given a `BluetoothGATTService`,
but we wouldn't want to return a different one than
the component-using-the-Service controlled the lifetime of.
However, because events bubble, this would result in a separate, e.g.,
`characteristicvaluechanged` event to arrive at the `BluetoothDevice` for each connection.
To avoid that, we have only one connection per device.

## Why is `BluetoothGATTRemoteServer` created lazily?

If/when Bluetooth devices support more than GATT communication,
this may allow implementations to avoid creating data structures that aren't used.

## Why are GATT connection and disconnection asymmetric?

`BluetoothGATTRemoteServer.disconnect()` exists
to release the current script's claim on the GATT connection,
but there's no parallel `BluetoothGATTRemoteServer.connect()`.
Users just have to call `BluetoothDevice.connectGATT()` again.
If we made users call `BluetoothDevice.gattServer.connect()`,
it would still need to return a `Promise<BluetoothGATTRemoteServer>` (WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth#65),
and would just be more characters in the common case.
We could provide both, but they'd be two ways of spelling the same operation,
which seems more confusing than worth it.

## Why doesn't `BluetoothGATTRemoteServer.disconnect()` return a `Promise`?

Disconnection can easily take effect synchronously
(if it is physically asynchronous, simply discard events that came in after it was requested).
We're also not signaling any error conditions from the disconnection:
if other operations were in flight, they'll return a NetworkError,
which still allows the possibility that they took effect.

## Why is the blocklist at https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/registries a custom file format?

The initial blocklist design desired the simplest solution that supported:
- Comments
- Pairs of validated UUIDs, possibly labeled with an exclusion tokens

The minimal text file definition is simple, UUIDs are separated from tokens
by only a space and listed one per line.
There are no needs for additional structural parsing complexity.

A solution such as JSON does not support comments, UUID or token validation,
but adds structural parsing complexity.

E.g.

```
00001812-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
00002a02-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb exclude-writes
```

```
versus:
{
  "00001812-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb": "excludes",
  "00002a02-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb": "exclude-writes"
}
```
