  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  <p>
    <a href="https://developer.bluetooth.org/">Bluetooth</a> is
    a standard for short-range wireless communication between devices.
    Bluetooth "Classic" (<abbr title="Basic Rate">BR</abbr>/<abbr title="Enhanced Data Rate">EDR</abbr>)
    defines a set of binary protocols and supports speeds up to about 24Mbps.
    Bluetooth 4.0 introduced a new "Low Energy" mode known as "Bluetooth Smart",
    <abbr title="Bluetooth Low Energy">BLE</abbr>, or just <abbr title="Low Energy">LE</abbr>
    which is limited to about 1Mbps but
    allows devices to leave their transmitters off most of the time.
    BLE provides most of its functionality through key/value pairs provided by
    the <a lt="Generic Attribute Profile">Generic Attribute Profile
    (<abbr title="Generic Attribute Profile">GATT</abbr>)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    BLE defines multiple roles that devices can play.
    The <a>Broadcaster</a> and <a>Observer</a> roles are
    for transmitter- and receiver-only applications, respectively.
    Devices acting in the <a>Peripheral</a> role can receive connections,
    and devices acting in the <a>Central</a> role can connect to <a>Peripheral</a> devices.
  </p>

  <p>
    A device acting in either the <a>Peripheral</a> or <a>Central</a> role
    can host a <a>GATT Server</a>,
    which exposes a hierarchy of <a>Service</a>s, <a>Characteristic</a>s, and <a>Descriptor</a>s.
    See [[#information-model]] for more details about this hierarchy.
    Despite being designed to support BLE transport,
    the GATT protocol can also run over BR/EDR transport.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first version of this specification allows web pages,
    running on a UA in the <a>Central</a> role, to connect to <a>GATT Server</a>s
    over either a BR/EDR or LE connection.
    While this specification cites the [[BLUETOOTH42]] specification,
    it intends to also support communication
    among devices that only implement Bluetooth 4.0 or 4.1.

  <section>
    <h3 id="device-access-is-powerful">Device access is powerful</h3>

    <p>
      When a website requests access to devices using
      {{Bluetooth/requestDevice()}},
      it gets the ability to access all GATT services mentioned in the call.
      The UA MUST inform the user what capabilities these services give the website
      before asking which devices to entrust to it.
      If any services in the list aren't known to the UA,
      the UA MUST assume they give the site complete control over the device
      and inform the user of this risk.
      The UA MUST also allow the user to inspect what sites have access to what devices
      and <a lt="revoke Bluetooth access">revoke</a> these pairings.

    <p>
      The UA MUST NOT allow the user to pair entire classes of devices with a website.
      It is possible to construct a class of devices
      for which each individual device sends the same Bluetooth-level identifying information.
      UAs are not required to attempt to detect this sort of forgery
      and MAY let a user pair this pseudo-device with a website.

    <p>
      To help ensure that only the entity the user approved for access actually
      has access, this specification requires that only <a>secure contexts</a>
      can access Bluetooth devices.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="non-normative">
    <h3 id="server-takeovers">Trusted servers can serve malicious code</h3>

    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

    <p>
      Even if the user trusts an origin,
      that origin's servers or developers could be compromised,
      or the origin's site could be vulnerable to XSS attacks.
      Either could lead to users granting malicious code access to valuable devices.
      Origins should define a Content Security Policy ([[CSP3]])
      to reduce the risk of XSS attacks,
      but this doesn't help with compromised servers or developers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ability to retrieve granted devices after a page reload,
      provided by <a href="#permission-api-integration"></a>,
      makes this risk worse.
      Instead of having to get the user to grant access while the site is compromised,
      the attacker can take advantage of previously-granted devices
      if the user simply visits while the site is compromised.
      On the other hand, when sites can keep access to devices across page reloads,
      they don't have to show as many permission prompts overall,
      making it more likely that users will pay attention to the prompts they do see.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="attacks-on-devices">Attacks on devices</h3>

    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

    <p>
      Communication from websites can break the security model of some devices,
      which assume they only receive messages from
      the trusted operating system of a remote device.
      Human Interface Devices are a prominent example,
      where allowing a website to communicate would allow that site to log keystrokes.
      This specification includes a <a>GATT blocklist</a> of
      such vulnerable services, characteristics, and descriptors
      to prevent websites from taking advantage of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      We expect that many devices are vulnerable to unexpected data delivered to their radio.
      In the past, these devices had to be exploited one-by-one,
      but this API makes it plausible to conduct large-scale attacks.
      This specification takes several approaches to make such attacks more difficult:

    <ul>
      <li>
        Pairing individual devices instead of device classes
        requires at least a user action before a device can be exploited.

      <li>
        Constraining access to <a>GATT</a>, as opposed to generic byte-stream access,
        denies malicious websites access to most parsers on the device.

        <p>
          On the other hand,
          GATT's <a>Characteristic</a> and <a>Descriptor</a> values are still byte arrays,
          which may be set to lengths and formats the device doesn't expect.
          UAs are encouraged to validate these values when they can.

      <li>
        This API never exposes Bluetooth addressing, data signing or encryption keys
        (<a>Definition of Keys and Values</a>) to websites.
        This makes it more difficult for a website to predict the bits that will be sent over the radio,
        which blocks <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/woot11/tech/final_files/Goodspeed.pdf">packet-in-packet injection attacks</a>.
        Unfortunately, this only works over encrypted links,
        which not all BLE devices are required to support.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      UAs can also take further steps to protect their users:

    <ul>
      <li>
        A web service may collect lists of malicious websites and vulnerable devices.
        UAs can deny malicious websites access to any device
        and any website access to vulnerable devices.
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="bluetooth-device-identifiers">Bluetooth device identifiers</h3>

    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

    <p>
      Each Bluetooth BR/EDR device has a unique 48-bit MAC address
      known as the <a>BD_ADDR</a>.
      Each Bluetooth LE device has at least one of a <a>Public Device Address</a>
      and a <a>Static Device Address</a>.
      The <a>Public Device Address</a> is a MAC address.
      The <a>Static Device Address</a> may be regenerated on each restart.
      A BR/EDR/LE device will use the same value
      for the <a>BD_ADDR</a> and the <a>Public Device Address</a>
      (specified in the <a>Read BD_ADDR Command</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      An LE device may also have a unique, 128-bit <a>Identity Resolving Key</a>,
      which is sent to trusted devices during the bonding process.
      To avoid leaking a persistent identifier, an LE device may scan and advertise using

      Each Bluetooth device also has a human-readable <a>Bluetooth Device Name</a>.

      <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

      <p>
        If a website can retrieve any of the persistent device IDs,
        these can be used, in combination with a large effort to catalog ambient devices,
        to discover a user's location.
        A device ID can also be used to identify that a user who
        pairs two different websites with the same Bluetooth device
        is a single user.
        On the other hand, many GATT services are available
        that could be used to fingerprint a device,
        and a device can easily expose a custom GATT service to make this easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification <a href="#note-device-id-tracking">suggests</a> that
        the UA use different device IDs for a single device
        when its user doesn't intend scripts to learn that it's a single device,
        which makes it difficult for websites to abuse the device address like this.
        Device makers can still design their devices to help track users,
        but it takes work.

    <section>
      <h4 id="ua-bluetooth-address">The UA's Bluetooth address</h4>

      <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

      <p>
        In BR/EDR mode, or in LE mode during active scanning without the <a>Privacy Feature</a>,
        the UA broadcasts its persistent ID to any nearby Bluetooth radio.
        This makes it easy to scatter hostile devices in an area and track the UA.
        As of 2014-08, few or no platforms document that they implement the <a>Privacy Feature</a>,
        so despite this spec recommending it, few UAs are likely to use it.
        This spec does <a href="#requestDevice-user-gesture">require a user gesture</a>
        for a website to trigger a scan, which reduces the frequency of scans some,
        but it would still be better for more platforms to expose the <a>Privacy Feature</a>.

    <p>
      <code>navigator.bluetooth.{{getAvailability()}}</code>
      exposes whether a Bluetooth radio is available on the user's system,
      regardless of whether it is powered on or not.
      Some users might consider this private,
      although it's hard to imagine the damage that would result from revealing it.
      This information also increases the UA's <a>fingerprinting surface</a> by a bit.
      This function returns a {{Promise}},
      so UAs have the option of asking the user what value they want to return,
      but we expect the increased risk to be small enough that
      UAs will choose not to prompt.

      {{Bluetooth/getAvailability()}} informs the page
      whether Bluetooth is available at all.
      An adapter that's disabled through software should count as available.
      Changes in availability,
      for example when the user physically attaches or detaches an adapter,
      are reported through the {{availabilitychanged}} event.
    </p>
    <p class="unstable">
      {{Bluetooth/referringDevice}} gives access to
      the device from which the user opened this page, if any.
      For example, an <a href="https://developers.google.com/beacons/eddystone">Eddystone</a> beacon
      might advertise a URL, which the UA allows the user to open.
      A {{BluetoothDevice}} representing the beacon would be available
      through <code>navigator.bluetooth.{{referringDevice}}</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      {{Bluetooth/requestDevice(options)}} asks the user
      to grant this origin access to a device
      that <a>matches any filter</a> in <code>options.<dfn dict-member for="RequestDeviceOptions">filters</dfn></code>.
      To <a>match a filter</a>, the device has to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        support <em>all</em> the GATT service UUIDs
        in the <dfn dict-member for="BluetoothLEScanFilterInit">services</dfn> list

    <p link-for-hint="BluetoothDataFilterInit" class="unstable">
      Both <a>Manufacturer Specific Data</a> and <a>Service Data</a>
      map a key to an array of bytes.
      {{BluetoothDataFilterInit}} filters these arrays.
      An array matches if it has a |prefix| such that
      <code>|prefix| & {{mask}}</code> is equal to <code>{{dataPrefix}} & {{mask}}</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that
      if a device changes its behavior significantly when it connects,
      for example by not advertising its identifying manufacturer data anymore
      and instead having the client discover some identifying GATT services,
      the website may need to include filters for both behaviors.
    </p>
    <p>
      In rare cases,
      a device may not advertise enough distinguishing information
      to let a site filter out uninteresting devices.
      In those cases, a site can set
      <dfn dict-member for="RequestDeviceOptions">acceptAllDevices</dfn> to `true`
      and omit all {{RequestDeviceOptions/filters}}.
      This puts the burden of selecting the right device entirely on the site's users.
      If a site uses {{RequestDeviceOptions/acceptAllDevices}},
      it will only be able to use services listed in {{RequestDeviceOptions/optionalServices}}.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the user selects a device to pair with this origin,
      the origin is allowed to access any service whose UUID was listed
      in the {{BluetoothLEScanFilterInit/services}} list
      in any element of <code>options.filters</code>
      or in <code>options.<dfn dict-member for="RequestDeviceOptions">optionalServices</dfn></code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This implies that if developers filter just by name,
      they must use {{RequestDeviceOptions/optionalServices}} to get access to any services.

      });
    </pre>
    <p>
      the user will be shown a dialog containing devices D1 and D2.
      If the user selects D1, the website will not be able to access services C or D.
      If the user selects D2, the website will not be able to access service E.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, if the website calls
    </p>
    <pre highlight="js">
      navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({
        filters: [
          {services: [A, B]},
          {services: [C, D]}
        ]
      });
    </pre>
    <p>
      the dialog will contain devices D1, D2, and D3,
      and if the user selects D1,
      the website will be able to access services A, B, C, and D.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>optionalServices</code> list doesn't add any devices
      to the dialog the user sees,
      but it does affect which services the website can use from the device the user picks.

      but not D4, since D4 doesn't contain the required services.
      If the user selects D2, unlike in the first example,
      the website will be able to access services A, B, and E.
    </p>
    <p>
      The allowed services also apply if the device changes after the user grants access.
      For example, if the user selects D1 in the previous <code>requestDevice()</code> call,
      and D1 later adds a new E service,
      that will fire the {{serviceadded}} event,
      and the web page will be able to access service E.

                Connecting to every nearby device to discover services costs power and

                UAs should only discover extra services on a device if

                UAs should also help developers avoid relying on this extra discovery behavior.
                For example, say a developer has previously connected to a device,
                so the UA knows the device's full set of supported services.
                If this developer then filters using a non-advertised UUID,
                the dialog they see may include this device,
                even if the filter would likely exclude the device on users' machines.
                The UA could provide a developer option to warn when this happens or

    <p>
      The physical Bluetooth device may be guaranteed to have
      some properties that the UA may not have received.
      Those properties are described as optional here.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <dfn export>Bluetooth device</dfn> has the following properties.
      Optional properties are not present, and sequence and map properties are empty,
      unless/until described otherwise.
      Other properties have a default specified or are specified when a device is introduced.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        A set of <dfn>supported physical transports</dfn>,
        including one or both of BR/EDR and LE.
        This set will generally be filled based on
        the transports over which the device was discovered
        and the <a>Flags Data Type</a>
        in the <a>Advertising Data</a> or <a>Extended Inquiry Response</a>.

        One or more of several kinds of 48-bit address:

      </li>
      <li>An optional 128-bit <a>Identity Resolving Key</a>.</li>

      <li>
        An optional partial or complete <a>Bluetooth Device Name</a>.
        A device has a partial name when the <a>Shortened Local Name</a> AD data was received,
        but the full name hasn't been read yet.
        The <a>Bluetooth Device Name</a> is encoded as UTF-8 and
        converted to a DOMString using the <a>utf-8 decode without BOM</a> algorithm.
      </li>

      <li>
        An optional <a>ATT Bearer</a>, over which all GATT communication happens.
        The <a>ATT Bearer</a> is created by procedures described in
        "Connection Establishment" under <a>GAP Interoperability Requirements</a>.
        It is disconnected in ways [[BLUETOOTH42]] isn't entirely clear about.
      </li>

      <li>
        A list of advertised <a>Service UUIDs</a>
        from the <a>Advertising Data</a> or <a>Extended Inquiry Response</a>.

      or if the <a>Resolvable Private Address Resolution Procedure</a> succeeds using
      one device's IRK and the other's Resolvable <a>Private Address</a>.

      </p>
      <p>
        Profiles are purely logical:
        the specification of a Profile describes the expected interactions between
        the other GATT entities the Profile contains,
        but it's impossible to query which Profiles a device supports.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a>GATT Client</a>s can discover and interact with
        the Services, Characteristics, and Descriptors on a device
        using a set of <a>GATT procedures</a>.
        This spec refers to Services, Characteristics, and Descriptors
        collectively as <dfn>Attribute</dfn>s.
        All Attributes have a type that's identified by a <a>UUID</a>.
        Each Attribute also has a 16-bit <a>Attribute Handle</a>
        that distinguishes it from other Attributes
        of the same type on the same <a>GATT Server</a>.
        Attributes are notionally ordered within their <a>GATT Server</a>
        by their <a>Attribute Handle</a>,
        but while platform interfaces provide attributes in some order,
        they do not guarantee that it's consistent with the <a>Attribute Handle</a> order.

      The Bluetooth <a>Attribute Caching</a> system allows <a>bonded</a> clients
      to save references to attributes from one connection to the next.
      Web Bluetooth treats websites as <em>not</em> <a>bonded</a>
      to devices they have permission to access:
      {{BluetoothRemoteGATTService}}, {{BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic}},
      and {{BluetoothRemoteGATTDescriptor}} objects
      become invalid on <a href="#disconnection-events">disconnection</a>,
      and the site must retrieved them again when it re-connects.

    <section>
      <h4 id="bluetooth-cache" dfn-type="dfn" data-lt="Bluetooth cache">The Bluetooth cache</h4>

      <p>
        The UA MUST maintain a <a>Bluetooth cache</a>
        of the hierarchy of Services, Characteristics, and Descriptors
        it has discovered on a device.
        The UA MAY share this cache between multiple origins accessing the same device.
        Each potential entry in the cache is either known-present, known-absent, or unknown.
        The cache MUST NOT contain two entries that are for the <a>same attribute</a>.
        Each known-present entry in the cache is associated with an optional
        <code>Promise&lt;{{BluetoothRemoteGATTService}}></code>,
        <code>Promise&lt;{{BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic}}></code>,
        or <code>Promise&lt;{{BluetoothRemoteGATTDescriptor}}></code> instance
        for each {{Bluetooth}} instance.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        For example, if a user calls the <code>serviceA.getCharacteristic(uuid1)</code> function
        with an initially empty <a>Bluetooth cache</a>,
        the UA uses the <a>Discover Characteristics by UUID</a> procedure
        to fill the needed cache entries,
        and the UA ends the procedure early because
        it only needs one Characteristic to fulfil the returned {{Promise}},
        then the first Characteristic with UUID <code>uuid1</code> inside <code>serviceA</code>
        is known-present,
        and any subsequent Characteristics with that UUID remain unknown.
        If the user later calls <code>serviceA.getCharacteristics(uuid1)</code>,
        the UA needs to resume or restart the <a>Discover Characteristics by UUID</a> procedure.
        If it turns out that
        <code>serviceA</code> only has one Characteristic with UUID <code>uuid1</code>,
        then the subsequent Characteristics become known-absent.
      </p>

      <p>
        The known-present entries in the <a>Bluetooth cache</a> are ordered:
        Primary Services appear in a particular order within a device,
        Included Services and Characteristics appear in a particular order within Services,
        and Descriptors appear in a particular order within Characteristics.
        The order SHOULD match the order of <a>Attribute Handle</a>s on the device,
        but UAs MAY use another order if the device's order isn't available.

                  The UA MAY attempt to bond with the remote device using
                  the <a>BR/EDR Bonding Procedure</a> or
                  the <a>LE Bonding Procedure</a>.

                  Note: We would normally prefer to give the website control
                  over whether and when bonding happens,
                  but the [Core Bluetooth](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/CoreBluetooth_concepts/AboutCoreBluetooth/Introduction.html)
                  platform API doesn't provide a way for UAs to implement such a knob.
                  Having a bond is more secure than not having one,
                  so this specification allows the UA to opportunistically create one
                  on platforms where that's possible.
                  This may cause a user-visible pairing dialog to appear
                  when a connection is created,
                  instead of when a restricted characteristic is accessed.

    <h3 id="error-handling">Error handling</h3>

    <p class="note">
      This section primarily defines the mapping from system errors to Javascript error names
      and allows UAs to retry certain operations.
      The retry logic and possible error distinctions
      are highly constrained by the operating system,
      so places these requirements don't reflect reality
      are likely <a href="https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/issues">spec bugs</a>
      instead of browser bugs.
    </p>

    <div algorithm="error handling">
      <p>
        When the UA is using a <a>GATT procedure</a>
        to execute a step in an algorithm or to handle a query to the <a>Bluetooth cache</a>
        (both referred to as a "step", here),
        and the GATT procedure returns an <code><a>Error Response</a></code>,
        the UA MUST perform the following steps:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          If the <a>procedure times out</a> or
          the ATT Bearer (described in <a>Profile Fundamentals</a>) is
          absent or terminated for any reason,
          return a {{NetworkError}} from the step and abort these steps.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take the following actions depending on the <code>Error Code</code>:
          <dl class="switch">
            <dt><code>Invalid PDU</code></dt>

            <dt><code>Unsupported Group Type</code></dt>
            <dd>
              These error codes indicate that something unexpected happened at the protocol layer,
              likely either due to a UA or device bug.
              Return a {{NotSupportedError}} from the step.
            </dd>

            <dt><code>Invalid Handle</code></dt>

            <dt><code>Attribute Not Long</code></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                If this error code is received without having used a "Long" sub-procedure,
                this may indicate a device bug.
                Return a {{NotSupportedError}} from the step.
              </p>

              <p>
                Otherwise, retry the step without using a "Long" sub-procedure.
                If this is impossible due to the length of the value being written,
                return an {{InvalidModificationError}} from the step.

            <dd>
              The UA SHOULD attempt to increase the security level of the connection.
              If this attempt fails or the UA doesn't support any higher security,
              Return a {{SecurityError}} from the step.

  <h2 id="uuids">UUIDs</h2>

  <pre class="idl">typedef DOMString UUID;</pre>
  <p>
    A <a>UUID</a> string represents a 128-bit [[!RFC4122]] UUID.
    A <dfn>valid UUID</dfn> is a string that matches
    the [[!ECMAScript]] regexp
    <code>/^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/</code>.
    That is, a <a>valid UUID</a> is lower-case and
    does not use the 16- or 32-bit abbreviations defined by the Bluetooth standard.
    All UUIDs returned from functions and attributes in this specification
    MUST be <a>valid UUID</a>s.
    If a function in this specification takes a parameter whose type is <a>UUID</a>
    or a dictionary including a <a>UUID</a> attribute,
    and the argument passed in any <a>UUID</a> slot is not a <a>valid UUID</a>,
    the function MUST return <a>a promise rejected with</a> a <code>TypeError</code>
    and abort its other steps.
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    This standard provides the
    <code>BluetoothUUID.<a for="BluetoothUUID">canonicalUUID(<var>alias</var>)</a></code> function
    to map a 16- or 32-bit Bluetooth <a>UUID alias</a> to its 128-bit form.
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    Bluetooth devices are required to convert 16- and 32-bit UUIDs to 128-bit UUIDs
    before comparing them (as described in <a>Attribute Type</a>), but not all devices do so.
    To interoperate with these devices,
    if the UA has received a UUID from the device in one form (16-, 32-, or 128-bit),
    it should send other aliases of that UUID back to the device in the same form.

  <h2 id="terminology">Terminology and Conventions</h2>

  <p>
    This specification uses a few conventions and several terms from other specifications.
    This section lists those and links to their primary definitions.
  </p>

  <p>
    When an algorithm in this specification uses a name defined in this or another specification,
    the name MUST resolve to its initial value,
    ignoring any changes that have been made to the name in the current execution environment.
    For example, when the {{Bluetooth/requestDevice()}} algorithm says to call
    <code>{{Array.prototype.map}}.call(<var>filter</var>.services,
      {{BluetoothUUID/getService()|BluetoothUUID.getService}})</code>,
    this MUST apply the
    {{Array.prototype.map}} algorithm defined in [[ECMAScript]]
    with <code><var>filter</var>.services</code> as its <code>this</code> parameter and
    the algorithm defined in <a href="#standardized-uuids"></a>
    for {{BluetoothUUID/getService()|BluetoothUUID.getService}}
    as its <code>callbackfn</code> parameter,
    regardless of any modifications that have been made to <code>window</code>,
    <code>Array</code>, <code>Array.prototype</code>, <code>Array.prototype.map</code>,
    <code>Function</code>, <code>Function.prototype</code>, <code>BluetoothUUID</code>,
    <code>BluetoothUUID.getService</code>, or other objects.
  </p>

  <p>
    This specification uses a read-only type
    that is similar to WebIDL's {{FrozenArray}}.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A <dfn>read only ArrayBuffer</dfn> has {{ArrayBuffer}}'s values and interface,
      except that attempting to write to its contents or transfer it
      has the same effect as trying to write to a {{FrozenArray}}'s contents.
      This applies to {{TypedArray}}s and {{DataView}}s
      wrapped around the {{ArrayBuffer}} too.
    </li>
  </ul>
