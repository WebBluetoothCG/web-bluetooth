# Introduction # {#introduction}

*This section is non-normative.*

<a href="https://developer.bluetooth.org/">Bluetooth</a> is a standard for
short-range wireless communication between devices. Bluetooth "Classic" (<abbr
title="Basic Rate">BR</abbr>/<abbr title="Enhanced Data Rate">EDR</abbr>)
defines a set of binary protocols and supports speeds up to about 24Mbps.
Bluetooth 4.0 introduced a new "Low Energy" mode known as "Bluetooth Smart",
<abbr title="Bluetooth Low Energy">BLE</abbr>, or just <abbr title="Low
Energy">LE</abbr>
which is limited to about 1Mbps but allows devices to leave their transmitters
off most of the time. BLE provides most of its functionality through key/value
pairs provided by the <a lt="Generic Attribute Profile">Generic Attribute
Profile (<abbr title="Generic Attribute Profile">GATT</abbr>)</a>.

BLE defines multiple roles that devices can play. The <a>Broadcaster</a> and
<a>Observer</a> roles are for transmitter- and receiver-only applications,
respectively. Devices acting in the <a>Peripheral</a> role can receive
connections, and devices acting in the <a>Central</a> role can connect to
<a>Peripheral</a> devices.

A device acting in either the <a>Peripheral</a> or <a>Central</a> role can host
a <a>GATT Server</a>, which exposes a hierarchy of <a>Service</a>s,
<a>Characteristic</a>s, and <a>Descriptor</a>s. See [[#information-model]] for
more details about this hierarchy. Despite being designed to support BLE
transport, the GATT protocol can also run over BR/EDR transport.

The first version of this specification allows web pages, running on a UA in the
<a>Central</a> role, to connect to <a>GATT Server</a>s over either a BR/EDR or
LE connection. While this specification cites the [[BLUETOOTH42]] specification,
it intends to also support communication among devices that only implement
Bluetooth 4.0 or 4.1.

## Examples ## {#introduction-examples}

<div class="example" id="example-heart-rate-monitor">
To discover and retrieve data from a standard heart rate monitor,
a website would use code like the following:

<pre highlight="js">
  let chosenHeartRateService = null;

  navigator.bluetooth.<a idl for="Bluetooth" lt="requestDevice()">requestDevice</a>({
    filters: [{
      services: ['heart_rate'],
    }]
  }).then(device => device.gatt.<a for="BluetoothRemoteGATTServer">connect()</a>)
  .then(server => server.<a idl for="BluetoothRemoteGATTServer" lt="getPrimaryService()"
    >getPrimaryService</a>(<a idl lt="heart_rate">'heart_rate'</a>))
  .then(service => {
    chosenHeartRateService = service;
    return Promise.all([
      service.<a idl for="BluetoothRemoteGATTService" lt="getCharacteristic()">getCharacteristic</a>(<a idl lt="body_sensor_location">'body_sensor_location'</a>)
        .then(handleBodySensorLocationCharacteristic),
      service.<a idl for="BluetoothRemoteGATTService" lt="getCharacteristic()">getCharacteristic</a>(<a idl lt="heart_rate_measurement">'heart_rate_measurement'</a>)
        .then(handleHeartRateMeasurementCharacteristic),
    ]);
  });

  function handleBodySensorLocationCharacteristic(characteristic) {
    if (characteristic === null) {
      console.log("Unknown sensor location.");
      return Promise.resolve();
    }
    return characteristic.<a for="BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic">readValue()</a>
    .then(sensorLocationData => {
      const sensorLocation = sensorLocationData.getUint8(0);
      switch (sensorLocation) {
        case 0: return 'Other';
        case 1: return 'Chest';
        case 2: return 'Wrist';
        case 3: return 'Finger';
        case 4: return 'Hand';
        case 5: return 'Ear Lobe';
        case 6: return 'Foot';
        default: return 'Unknown';
      }
    }).then(location => console.log(location));
  }

  function handleHeartRateMeasurementCharacteristic(characteristic) {
    return characteristic.<a for="BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic">startNotifications()</a>
    .then(char => {
      characteristic.addEventListener('<a event>characteristicvaluechanged</a>',
                                      onHeartRateChanged);
    });
  }

  function onHeartRateChanged(event) {
    const characteristic = event.target;
    console.log(parseHeartRate(characteristic.<a attribute for="BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic">value</a>));
  }
</pre>

<code>parseHeartRate()</code> would be defined using the
<a idl lt="heart_rate_measurement">
<code>heart_rate_measurement</code> documentation</a>
to read the {{DataView}} stored in a {{BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic}}'s
{{BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic/value}} field.

<pre highlight="js">
  function parseHeartRate(data) {
    const flags = data.getUint8(0);
    const rate16Bits = flags & 0x1;
    const result = {};
    let index = 1;
    if (rate16Bits) {
      result.heartRate = data.getUint16(index, /*littleEndian=*/true);
      index += 2;
    } else {
      result.heartRate = data.getUint8(index);
      index += 1;
    }
    const contactDetected = flags & 0x2;
    const contactSensorPresent = flags & 0x4;
    if (contactSensorPresent) {
      result.contactDetected = !!contactDetected;
    }
    const energyPresent = flags & 0x8;
    if (energyPresent) {
      result.energyExpended = data.getUint16(index, /*littleEndian=*/true);
      index += 2;
    }
    const rrIntervalPresent = flags & 0x10;
    if (rrIntervalPresent) {
      const rrIntervals = [];
      for (; index + 1 < data.byteLength; index += 2) {
        rrIntervals.push(data.getUint16(index, /*littleEndian=*/true));
      }
      result.rrIntervals = rrIntervals;
    }
    return result;
  }
</pre>

<code>onHeartRateChanged()</code> might log an object like
<pre highlight="js">
  {
    heartRate: 70,
    contactDetected: true,
    energyExpended: 750,     // Meaning 750kJ.
    rrIntervals: [890, 870]  // Meaning .87s and .85s.
  }
</pre>

If the heart rate sensor reports the <code>energyExpended</code> field, the web
application can reset its value to <code>0</code> by writing to the
{{heart_rate_control_point}}
characteristic:

<pre highlight="js">
  function resetEnergyExpended() {
    if (!chosenHeartRateService) {
      return Promise.reject(new Error('No heart rate sensor selected yet.'));
    }
    return chosenHeartRateService.<a idl for="BluetoothRemoteGATTService" lt="getCharacteristic()">getCharacteristic</a>(<a idl lt="heart_rate_control_point">'heart_rate_control_point'</a>)
    .then(controlPoint => {
      const resetEnergyExpended = new Uint8Array([1]);
      return controlPoint.<a idl for="BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic" lt="writeValue()">writeValue</a>(resetEnergyExpended);
    });
  }
</pre>
</div>

# Security considerations # {#security-and-privacy}

Issue(575): See <a href="#privacy"></a> section.

# Privacy considerations # {#privacy}

## Device access is powerful ## {#device-access-is-powerful}

When a website requests access to devices using {{Bluetooth/requestDevice()}},
it gets the ability to access all GATT services mentioned in the call. The UA
MUST inform the user what capabilities these services give the website before
asking which devices to entrust to it. If any services in the list aren't known
to the UA, the UA MUST assume they give the site complete control over the
device and inform the user of this risk. The UA MUST also allow the user to
inspect what sites have access to what devices and <a lt="revoke Bluetooth
access">revoke</a> these pairings.

The UA MUST NOT allow the user to pair entire classes of devices with a website.
It is possible to construct a class of devices for which each individual device
sends the same Bluetooth-level identifying information. UAs are not required to
attempt to detect this sort of forgery and MAY let a user pair this
pseudo-device with a website.

To help ensure that only the entity the user approved for access actually has
access, this specification requires that only <a>secure contexts</a> can access
Bluetooth devices.

## Trusted servers can serve malicious code ## {#server-takeovers}

*This section is non-normative.*

Even if the user trusts an origin, that origin's servers or developers could be
compromised, or the origin's site could be vulnerable to XSS attacks. Either
could lead to users granting malicious code access to valuable devices. Origins
should define a Content Security Policy ([[CSP3]]) to reduce the risk of XSS
attacks, but this doesn't help with compromised servers or developers.

The ability to retrieve granted devices after a page reload, provided by <a
href="#permission-api-integration"></a>, makes this risk worse. Instead of
having to get the user to grant access while the site is compromised, the
attacker can take advantage of previously-granted devices if the user simply
visits while the site is compromised. On the other hand, when sites can keep
access to devices across page reloads, they don't have to show as many
permission prompts overall, making it more likely that users will pay attention
to the prompts they do see.

## Attacks on devices ## {#attacks-on-devices}

*This section is non-normative.*

Communication from websites can break the security model of some devices, which
assume they only receive messages from the trusted operating system of a remote
device. Human Interface Devices are a prominent example, where allowing a
website to communicate would allow that site to log keystrokes. This
specification includes a <a>GATT blocklist</a> of such vulnerable services,
characteristics, and descriptors to prevent websites from taking advantage of
them.

We expect that many devices are vulnerable to unexpected data delivered to their
radio. In the past, these devices had to be exploited one-by-one, but this API
makes it plausible to conduct large-scale attacks. This specification takes
several approaches to make such attacks more difficult:

* Pairing individual devices instead of device classes requires at least a user
    action before a device can be exploited.

* Constraining access to <a>GATT</a>, as opposed to generic byte-stream access,
    denies malicious websites access to most parsers on the device.

    On the other hand, GATT's <a>Characteristic</a> and <a>Descriptor</a> values
    are still byte arrays, which may be set to lengths and formats the device
    doesn't expect. UAs are encouraged to validate these values when they can.

* This API never exposes Bluetooth addressing, data signing or encryption keys
    (<a>Definition of Keys and Values</a>) to websites. This makes it more
    difficult for a website to predict the bits that will be sent over the
    radio, which blocks <a
    href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/woot11/tech/final_files/Goodspeed.pdf">packet-in-packet
    injection attacks</a>. Unfortunately, this only works over encrypted links,
    which not all BLE devices are required to support.

* The integration with [[#permissions-policy]] provides protection against unwanted
    access to Bluetooth capabilities, which requires the top-level document to
    explicitly allow a cross-origin iframe to use the API's methods.

UAs can also take further steps to protect their users:

* A web service may collect lists of malicious websites and vulnerable devices.
    UAs can deny malicious websites access to any device and any website access to
    vulnerable devices.

## Bluetooth device identifiers ## {#bluetooth-device-identifiers}

*This section is non-normative.*

Each Bluetooth BR/EDR device has a unique 48-bit MAC address known as the
<a>BD_ADDR</a>. Each Bluetooth LE device has at least one of a <a>Public Device
Address</a> and a <a>Static Device Address</a>. The <a>Public Device Address</a>
is a MAC address. The <a>Static Device Address</a> may be regenerated on each
restart. A BR/EDR/LE device will use the same value for the <a>BD_ADDR</a> and
the <a>Public Device Address</a> (specified in the <a>Read BD_ADDR Command</a>).

An LE device may also have a unique, 128-bit <a>Identity Resolving Key</a>,
which is sent to trusted devices during the bonding process. To avoid leaking a
persistent identifier, an LE device may scan and advertise using a random
Resolvable or Non-Resolvable <a>Private Address</a> instead of its Static or
Public Address. These are regenerated periodically (approximately every 15
minutes), but a bonded device can check whether one of its stored <a>IRK</a>s
matches any given Resolvable Private Address using the <a>Resolvable Private
Address Resolution Procedure</a>.

Each Bluetooth device also has a human-readable <a>Bluetooth Device Name</a>.
These aren't guaranteed to be unique, but may well be, depending on the device
type.

### Identifiers for remote Bluetooth devices ### {#remote-device-identifiers}

*This section is non-normative.*

If a website can retrieve any of the persistent device IDs, these can be used,
in combination with a large effort to catalog ambient devices, to discover a
user's location. A device ID can also be used to identify that a user who pairs
two different websites with the same Bluetooth device is a single user. On the
other hand, many GATT services are available that could be used to fingerprint a
device, and a device can easily expose a custom GATT service to make this
easier.

This specification <a href="#note-device-id-tracking">suggests</a> that the UA
use different device IDs for a single device when its user doesn't intend
scripts to learn that it's a single device, which makes it difficult for
websites to abuse the device address like this. Device makers can still design
their devices to help track users, but it takes work.

### The UA's Bluetooth address ### {#ua-bluetooth-address}

*This section is non-normative.*

In BR/EDR mode, or in LE mode during active scanning without the <a>Privacy
Feature</a>, the UA broadcasts its persistent ID to any nearby Bluetooth radio.
This makes it easy to scatter hostile devices in an area and track the UA. As of
2014-08, few or no platforms document that they implement the <a>Privacy
Feature</a>, so despite this spec recommending it, few UAs are likely to use it.
This spec does <a href="#requestDevice-user-gesture">require a user gesture</a>
for a website to trigger a scan, which reduces the frequency of scans some, but
it would still be better for more platforms to expose the <a>Privacy
Feature</a>.

## Exposing Bluetooth availability ## {#availability-fingerprint}

*This section is non-normative.*

<code>navigator.bluetooth.{{getAvailability()}}</code> exposes whether a
Bluetooth radio is available on the user's system, regardless of whether it is
powered on or not. The availability is also affected if the user has configured
the UA to block Web Bluetooth. Some users might consider this private, although
it's hard to imagine the damage that would result from revealing it. This
information also increases the UA's <a>fingerprinting surface</a> by a bit. This
function returns a {{Promise}}, so UAs have the option of asking the user what
value they want to return, but we expect the increased risk to be small enough
that UAs will choose not to prompt.

<div class="note" heading="{{Bluetooth}} members">
Note: {{Bluetooth/getAvailability()}} informs the page whether Bluetooth is
available at all. An adapter that's disabled through software should count as
available. Changes in availability, for example when the user physically
attaches or detaches an adapter, are reported through the
{{availabilitychanged}} event.

<p class="unstable">
  {{Bluetooth/referringDevice}} gives access to the device from which the user
  opened this page, if any. For example, an <a
  href="https://developers.google.com/beacons/eddystone">Eddystone</a> beacon
  might advertise a URL, which the UA allows the user to open. A
  {{BluetoothDevice}} representing the beacon would be available through
  <code>navigator.bluetooth.{{referringDevice}}</code>.
</p>

<p class="unstable">
  {{Bluetooth/getDevices()}} enables the page to retrieve Bluetooth devices that
  the user has granted access to.
</p>

{{Bluetooth/requestDevice(options)}} asks the user to grant this origin access
to a device that <a>matches any filter</a> in <code>options.<dfn dict-member
for="RequestDeviceOptions">filters</dfn></code>. To <a>match a filter</a>, the
device has to:

* support <em>all</em> the GATT service UUIDs in the <dfn dict-member
    for="BluetoothLEScanFilterInit">services</dfn> list if that member is
    present,
* have a name equal to <dfn dict-member
    for="BluetoothLEScanFilterInit">name</dfn> if that member is present,
* have a name starting with <dfn dict-member
    for="BluetoothLEScanFilterInit">namePrefix</dfn> if that member is present,
* advertise <a>manufacturer specific data</a> matching all of the values in
    <dfn dict-member for="BluetoothLEScanFilterInit">manufacturerData</dfn> if
    that member is present, and
* <div class="unstable"> advertise <a>service data</a> matching all of the
    values in <dfn dict-member
    for="BluetoothLEScanFilterInit">serviceData</dfn> if that member is
    present.</div>

<p link-for-hint="BluetoothDataFilterInit">
  Both <a>Manufacturer Specific Data</a> and <a>Service Data</a> map a key to an
  array of bytes. {{BluetoothDataFilterInit}} filters these arrays. An array
  matches if it has a |prefix| such that <code>|prefix| & {{mask}}</code> is
  equal to <code>{{dataPrefix}} & {{mask}}</code>.
</p>

Note that if a device changes its behavior significantly when it connects, for
example by not advertising its identifying manufacturer data anymore and instead
having the client discover some identifying GATT services, the website may need
to include filters for both behaviors.

In rare cases, a device may not advertise enough distinguishing information to
let a site filter out uninteresting devices. In those cases, a site can set <dfn
dict-member for="RequestDeviceOptions">acceptAllDevices</dfn> to `true` and omit
all {{RequestDeviceOptions/filters}}. This puts the burden of selecting the
right device entirely on the site's users. If a site uses
{{RequestDeviceOptions/acceptAllDevices}}, it will only be able to use services
listed in {{RequestDeviceOptions/optionalServices}}.

After the user selects a device to pair with this origin, the origin is allowed
to access any service whose UUID was listed in the
{{BluetoothLEScanFilterInit/services}} list in any element of
<code>options.filters</code> or in <code>options.<dfn dict-member
for="RequestDeviceOptions">optionalServices</dfn></code>. The origin is also
allowed to access any manufacturer data from manufacturer codes defined in
<code>options.<dfn dict-member
for="RequestDeviceOptions">optionalManufacturerData</dfn></code> from the
device's advertisement data.

This implies that if developers filter just by name, they must use
{{RequestDeviceOptions/optionalServices}} to get access to any services.
</div>

<div class="example" id="example-filter-by-services">
Say the UA is close to the following devices:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Device</th>
    <th>Advertised Services</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D1</td>
    <td>A, B, C, D</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D2</td>
    <td>A, B, E</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D3</td>
    <td>C, D</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D4</td>
    <td>E</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D5</td>
    <td><i>&lt;none></i></td>
  </tr>
</table>

If the website calls

<pre highlight="js">
  navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({
    filters: [ {services: [A, B]} ]
  });
</pre>

the user will be shown a dialog containing devices D1 and D2. If the user
selects D1, the website will not be able to access services C or D. If the user
selects D2, the website will not be able to access service E.

On the other hand, if the website calls

<pre highlight="js">
  navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({
    filters: [
      {services: [A, B]},
      {services: [C, D]}
    ]
  });
</pre>

the dialog will contain devices D1, D2, and D3, and if the user selects D1, the
website will be able to access services A, B, C, and D.

If the website then calls

<pre highlight="js">
  navigator.bluetooth.getDevices();
</pre>

the resulting {{Promise}} will resolve into an array containing device D1, and
the website will be able to access services A, B, C, and D.

The <code>optionalServices</code> list doesn't add any devices to the dialog the
user sees, but it does affect which services the website can use from the device
the user picks.

<pre highlight="js">
  navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({
    filters: [ {services: [A, B]} ],
    optionalServices: \[E]
  });
</pre>

Shows a dialog containing D1 and D2, but not D4, since D4 doesn't contain the
required services. If the user selects D2, unlike in the first example, the
website will be able to access services A, B, and E.

If the website calls

<pre highlight="js">
  navigator.bluetooth.getDevices();
</pre>

again, then the resulting {{Promise}} will resolve into an array containing the
devices D1 and D2. The A, B, C, and D services will be accessible on device D1,
while A, B, and E services will be accessible on device D2.

The allowed services also apply if the device changes after the user grants
access. For example, if the user selects D1 in the previous
<code>requestDevice()</code> call, and D1 later adds a new E service, that will
fire the {{serviceadded}} event, and the web page will be able to access service
E.

    Issue: Both <a>passive scanning</a> and the <a>Privacy Feature</a> avoid

          UAs should also help developers avoid relying on this extra discovery
          behavior. For example, say a developer has previously connected to a
          device, so the UA knows the device's full set of supported services.
          If this developer then filters using a non-advertised UUID, the dialog
          they see may include this device, even if the filter would likely
          exclude the device on users' machines. The UA could provide a

## Overall Bluetooth availability ## {#availability}

The UA may be running on a computer that has no Bluetooth radio.
{{requestDevice()}} handles this by failing to discover any devices, which
results in a {{NotFoundError}}, but websites may be able to handle it more
gracefully.

<div class="example" id="example-getavailability">

# Device Representation # {#device-representation}

The UA needs to track Bluetooth device properties at several levels: globally,
per origin, and per <a>global object</a>.

## Global Bluetooth device properties ## {#global-device-properties}

The physical Bluetooth device may be guaranteed to have some properties that the
UA may not have received. Those properties are described as optional here.

A <dfn export>Bluetooth device</dfn> has the following properties. Optional
properties are not present, and sequence and map properties are empty,
unless/until described otherwise. Other properties have a default specified or
are specified when a device is introduced.

* A set of <dfn>supported physical transports</dfn>, including one or both of
    BR/EDR and LE. This set will generally be filled based on the transports
    over which the device was discovered and the <a>Flags Data Type</a> in the
    <a>Advertising Data</a> or <a>Extended Inquiry Response</a>.
* One or more of several kinds of 48-bit address: a <a>Public Bluetooth
    Address</a>, a (random) <a>Static Address</a>, and a resolvable or
    non-resolvable <a>Private Address</a>.
* An optional 128-bit <a>Identity Resolving Key</a>.
* An optional partial or complete <a>Bluetooth Device Name</a>. A device has a
    partial name when the <a>Shortened Local Name</a> AD data was received, but
    the full name hasn't been read yet. The <a>Bluetooth Device Name</a> is
    encoded as UTF-8 and converted to a DOMString using the <a>utf-8 decode
    without BOM</a> algorithm.
* An optional <a>ATT Bearer</a>, over which all GATT communication happens. The
    <a>ATT Bearer</a> is created by procedures described in "Connection
    Establishment" under <a>GAP Interoperability Requirements</a>. It is
    disconnected in ways [[BLUETOOTH42]] isn't entirely clear about.
* A list of advertised <a>Service UUIDs</a> from the <a>Advertising Data</a> or
    <a>Extended Inquiry Response</a>.
* A hierarchy of GATT <a>Attributes</a>.

The UA SHOULD determine that two <a>Bluetooth device</a>s are the <dfn export
local-lt="same device">same Bluetooth device</dfn> if and only if they have the
same <a>Public Bluetooth Address</a>, <a>Static Address</a>, <a>Private
Address</a>, or <a>Identity Resolving Key</a>, or if the <a>Resolvable Private
Address Resolution Procedure</a> succeeds using one device's IRK and the other's
Resolvable <a>Private Address</a>. However, because platform APIs don't document
how they determine device identity, the UA MAY use another procedure.

## BluetoothDevice ## {#bluetoothdevice-interface}

A {{BluetoothDevice}} instance represents a <a>Bluetooth device</a> for a
particular <a>global object</a> (or, equivalently, for a particular <a>Realm</a>
or {{Bluetooth}} instance).

# GATT Interaction # {#gatt-interaction}

## GATT Information Model ## {#information-model}

<div class="note">
The <a>GATT Profile Hierarchy</a> describes how a
<a idl lt="BluetoothRemoteGATTServer">GATT Server</a> contains a hierarchy of
Profiles, Primary <a>Service</a>s, <a>Included Service</a>s,
<a>Characteristic</a>s, and <a>Descriptor</a>s.

Profiles are purely logical: the specification of a Profile describes the
expected interactions between the other GATT entities the Profile contains, but
it's impossible to query which Profiles a device supports.

<a>GATT Client</a>s can discover and interact with the Services,
Characteristics, and Descriptors on a device using a set of <a>GATT
procedures</a>. This spec refers to Services, Characteristics, and Descriptors
collectively as <dfn>Attribute</dfn>s. All Attributes have a type that's
identified by a <a>UUID</a>. Each Attribute also has a 16-bit <a>Attribute
Handle</a> that distinguishes it from other Attributes of the same type on the
same <a>GATT Server</a>. Attributes are notionally ordered within their <a>GATT
Server</a> by their <a>Attribute Handle</a>, but while platform interfaces
provide attributes in some order, they do not guarantee that it's consistent
with the <a>Attribute Handle</a> order.

<p link-for-hint="BluetoothRemoteGATTService">
A <a idl lt="BluetoothRemoteGATTService">Service</a> contains a collection of
<a idl lt="getIncludedService()">Included Service</a>s and
<a idl lt="getCharacteristic()">Characteristic</a>s. The Included Services are
references to other Services, and a single Service can be included by more than
one other Service. Services are known as <a idl lt="isPrimary">Primary
Services</a> if they appear directly under the
<a idl lt="BluetoothRemoteGATTServer">GATT Server</a>, and Secondary Services if
they're only included by other Services, but Primary Services can also be
included.
</p>
<p link-for-hint="BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic">
A <a idl lt="BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic">Characteristic</a> contains a
value, which is an array of bytes, and a collection of
<a idl lt="getDescriptor()">Descriptor</a>s. Depending on the
<a idl lt="BluetoothCharacteristicProperties">properties</a> of the
Characteristic, a <a>GATT Client</a> can read or write its value, or register to
be notified when the value changes.
</p>

Finally, a <a idl lt="BluetoothRemoteGATTDescriptor">Descriptor</a> contains a
value (again an array of bytes) that describes or configures its
<a>Characteristic</a>.
</div>

### Persistence across connections ### {#persistence}

The Bluetooth <a>Attribute Caching</a> system allows <a>bonded</a> clients to
save references to attributes from one connection to the next. Web Bluetooth
treats websites as <em>not</em> <a>bonded</a> to devices they have permission to
access: {{BluetoothRemoteGATTService}}, {{BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic}},
and {{BluetoothRemoteGATTDescriptor}} objects become invalid on
<a href="#disconnection-events">disconnection</a>, and the site must retrieved
them again when it re-connects.

### The Bluetooth cache ### {#bluetooth-cache}

The UA MUST maintain a <dfn for="Bluetooth cache">Bluetooth cache</dfn> of the
hierarchy of Services, Characteristics, and Descriptors it has discovered on a
device. The UA MAY share this cache between multiple origins accessing the same
device. Each potential entry in the cache is either known-present, known-absent,
or unknown. The cache MUST NOT contain two entries that are for the <a>same
attribute</a>. Each known-present entry in the cache is associated with an
optional <code>Promise&lt;{{BluetoothRemoteGATTService}}></code>,
<code>Promise&lt;{{BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic}}></code>, or
<code>Promise&lt;{{BluetoothRemoteGATTDescriptor}}></code> instance for each
{{Bluetooth}} instance.

<div class="note">
Note: For example, if a user calls the
<code>serviceA.getCharacteristic(uuid1)</code> function with an initially empty
<a>Bluetooth cache</a>, the UA uses the <a>Discover Characteristics by UUID</a>
procedure to fill the needed cache entries, and the UA ends the procedure early
because it only needs one Characteristic to fulfil the returned {{Promise}},
then the first Characteristic with UUID <code>uuid1</code> inside
<code>serviceA</code> is known-present, and any subsequent Characteristics with
that UUID remain unknown. If the user later calls
<code>serviceA.getCharacteristics(uuid1)</code>, the UA needs to resume or
restart the <a>Discover Characteristics by UUID</a> procedure. If it turns out
that <code>serviceA</code> only has one Characteristic with UUID
<code>uuid1</code>, then the subsequent Characteristics become known-absent.
</div>

The known-present entries in the <a>Bluetooth cache</a> are ordered: Primary
Services appear in a particular order within a device, Included Services and
Characteristics appear in a particular order within Services, and Descriptors
appear in a particular order within Characteristics. The order SHOULD match the
order of <a>Attribute Handle</a>s on the device, but UAs MAY use another order
if the device's order isn't available.

<div algorithm="populate Bluetooth cache">
To <dfn>populate the Bluetooth cache</dfn> with entries matching some
description, the UA MUST run the following steps.

<div class="note">
Note: These steps can block, so uses of this algorithm must be <a>in
parallel</a>.
</div>

1. Attempt to make all matching entries in the cache either known-present or
    known-absent, using any sequence of <a>GATT procedures</a> that
    [[BLUETOOTH42]] specifies will return enough information. Handle errors as
    described in <a href="#error-handling"></a>.
1. If the previous step returns an error, return that error from this algorithm.

</div>

<div algorithm="query Bluetooth cache">
To <dfn>query the Bluetooth cache</dfn> in a {{BluetoothDevice}} instance
<var>deviceObj</var> for entries matching some description, the UA MUST return a
<code><var>deviceObj</var>.gatt</code>-<a>connection-checking wrapper</a> around
<a>a new promise</a> <var>promise</var> and run the following steps <a>in
parallel</a>:

1. <a>Populate the Bluetooth cache</a> with entries matching the description.
1. If the previous step returns an error, <a>reject</a> <var>promise</var> with
    that error and abort these steps.
1. Let <var>entries</var> be the sequence of known-present cache entries
    matching the description.
1. Let <var>context</var> be

1. Let <var>result</var> be a new sequence.

        <var>entry</var>, <a>create a

        <var>entry</var>, or <a>create a
        <code>BluetoothRemoteGATTDescriptor</code> representing</a>
        <var>entry</var>, depending on whether <var>entry</var> is a Service,
        Characteristic, or Descriptor, and add a mapping from <var>entry</var>
        to the resulting <code>Promise</code> in
        <var>context</var>.{{Bluetooth/[[attributeInstanceMap]]}}.
    1. Append to <var>result</var> the <code>Promise&lt;BluetoothGATT*></code>
        instance associated with <var>entry</var> in
        <var>context</var>.{{Bluetooth/[[attributeInstanceMap]]}}.

### Identifying Services, Characteristics, and Descriptors ### {#identifying-attributes}

When checking whether two Services, Characteristics, or Descriptors <var>a</var>
and <var>b</var> are the <dfn>same attribute</dfn>, the UA SHOULD determine that
they are the same if <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are inside the <a>same
device</a> and have the same <a>Attribute Handle</a>, but MAY use any algorithm
it wants with the constraint that <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> MUST NOT be
considered the <a>same attribute</a> if they fit any of the following
conditions:

* They are not both Services, both Characteristics, or both Descriptors.
* They are both Services, but are not both primary or both secondary services.
* They have different UUIDs.
* Their parent Devices aren't the <a>same device</a> or their parent Services or
    Characteristics aren't the <a>same attribute</a>.

<div class="note">
Note: This definition is loose because platform APIs expose their own notion of
identity without documenting whether it's based on <a>Attribute Handle</a>
equality.
</div>

<div class="note">
Note: For two Javascript objects <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> representing
Services, Characteristics, or Descriptors, <code><var>x</var> ===
<var>y</var></code> returns whether the objects represent the <a>same
attribute</a>, because of how the <a>query the Bluetooth cache</a> algorithm
creates and caches new objects.

        1. The UA MAY attempt to bond with the remote device using the <a>BR/EDR

            Note: We would normally prefer to give the website control over
            whether and when bonding happens, but the [Core
            Bluetooth](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/CoreBluetooth_concepts/AboutCoreBluetooth/Introduction.html)
            platform API doesn't provide a way for UAs to implement such a knob.
            Having a bond is more secure than not having one, so this
            specification allows the UA to opportunistically create one on
            platforms where that's possible. This may cause a user-visible
            pairing dialog to appear when a connection is created, instead of
            when a restricted characteristic is accessed.

### Responding to Notifications and Indications ### {#notification-events}

<div algorithm="notifications">
When the UA receives a Bluetooth <a>Characteristic Value Notification</a>
or <a lt="Characteristic Value Indications">Indication</a>,
it must perform the following steps:

1. For each <var>bluetoothGlobal</var> in the Characteristic's <a>active
    notification context set</a>, <a>queue a task</a> on the event loop of the
    script settings object of <var>bluetoothGlobal</var> to do the following
    sub-steps:
    1. Let <var>characteristicObject</var> be the
        {{BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic}} in the <a>Bluetooth tree</a>
        rooted at <var>bluetoothGlobal</var> that represents the
        <a>Characteristic</a>.
    1. If <code><var>characteristicObject</var>
        .service.device.gatt.{{BluetoothRemoteGATTServer/connected}}</code>
        is `false`, abort these sub-steps.
    1. Set <code><var>characteristicObject</var>.value</code> to a new
        {{DataView}} wrapping a new {{ArrayBuffer}} holding the new value of the
        <a>Characteristic</a>.
    1. <a>Fire an event</a> named {{characteristicvaluechanged}} with its
        <code>bubbles</code> attribute initialized to <code>true</code> at

### Responding to Service Changes ### {#service-change-events}

<div algorithm="service changes">
The Bluetooth <a>Attribute Caching</a> system allows clients to track changes to
<a>Service</a>s, <a>Characteristic</a>s, and <a>Descriptor</a>s. Before
discovering any of these attributes for the purpose of exposing them to a web
page the UA MUST subscribe to Indications from the <a>Service Changed</a>
characteristic, if it exists. When the UA receives an Indication on the Service
Changed characteristic, it MUST perform the following steps.

1. Let <var>removedAttributes</var> be the list of attributes in the range
    indicated by the Service Changed characteristic that the UA had discovered
    before the Indication.
1. Use the <a>Primary Service Discovery</a>, <a>Relationship Discovery</a>,
    <a>Characteristic Discovery</a>, and <a>Characteristic Descriptor
    Discovery</a> procedures to re-discover attributes in the range indicated by
    the Service Changed characteristic. The UA MAY skip discovering all or part
    of the indicated range if it can prove that the results of that discovery
    could not affect the events fired below.
1. Let <var>addedAttributes</var> be the list of attributes discovered in the
    previous step.
1. If an attribute with the same definition (see the <a>Service Interoperability
    Requirements</a>), ignoring Characteristic and Descriptor values, appears in
    both <var>removedAttributes</var> and <var>addedAttributes</var>, remove it
    from both.

    <div class="example" id="example-changed-service">

      A transition from state 1 to 2 leaves service A with "the same definition,
      ignoring Characteristic and Descriptor values", which means it's removed
      from both |removedAttributes| and |addedAttributes|, and it wouldn't
      appear in any {{servicechanged}} events.

      A transition from state 1 to 3 leaves service A with a different
      definition, because a <a>service definition</a> includes its
      characteristic definitions, so it's left in both |removedAttributes| and
      |addedAttributes|. Then in <a href="#same-service-removed-and-added">step
      8</a>, the service is moved to |changedServices|, which makes it cause a
      {{servicechanged}} event instead of both a {{serviceadded}} and
      {{serviceremoved}}.
      <a href="#characteristic-descriptor-change-adds-changed-service">
      Step 9</a> also adds service A to |changedServices| because characteristic
      C was removed and characteristic D was added.

      A transition from state 1 to 4 is similar to the 1->3 transition. Service
      B is moved to |changedServices| in <a
      href="#same-service-removed-and-added">step 8</a>, but no characteristics

## Error handling ## {#error-handling}

<div class="note">
Note: This section primarily defines the mapping from system errors to Javascript
error names and allows UAs to retry certain operations. The retry logic and
possible error distinctions are highly constrained by the operating system, so
places these requirements don't reflect reality are likely
<a href="https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/issues">spec bugs</a>
instead of browser bugs.
</div>

<div algorithm="error handling">
When the UA is using a <a>GATT procedure</a> to execute a step in an algorithm
or to handle a query to the <a>Bluetooth cache</a> (both referred to as a

Response</a></code>, the UA MUST perform the following steps:

1. If the <a>procedure times out</a> or the ATT Bearer (described in <a>Profile
    Fundamentals</a>) is absent or terminated for any reason, return a
    {{NetworkError}} from the step and abort these steps.

A <a>UUID</a> string represents a 128-bit [[!RFC4122]] UUID. A <dfn>valid

<code>/^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/</code>.
That is, a <a>valid UUID</a> is lower-case and does not use the 16- or 32-bit
abbreviations defined by the Bluetooth standard. All UUIDs returned from
functions and attributes in this specification MUST be <a>valid UUID</a>s. If a
function in this specification takes a parameter whose type is <a>UUID</a> or a

# The GATT Blocklist # {#the-gatt-blocklist}

This specification relies on a blocklist file in the
<a href="https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/registries">
  https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/registries</a> repository
to restrict the set of GATT attributes a website can access.

<div algorithm="parsing the GATT blocklist">
The result of <dfn>parsing the blocklist</dfn> at a URL <var>url</var> is a map
from <a>valid UUID</a>s to tokens, or an error, produced by the following
algorithm:

1. Fetch <var>url</var>, and let <var>contents</var> be its body, decoded as
    UTF-8.
1. Let <var>lines</var> be <var>contents</var> split on <code>'\n'</code>.
1. Let <var>result</var> be an empty map.
1. For each <var>line</var> in <var>lines</var>, do the following sub-steps:

    1. If <var>line</var> consists of just a <a>valid UUID</a>, let
        <var>uuid</var> be that UUID and let <var>token</var> be

# Extensions to the Navigator Interface # {#navigator-extensions}

  [SecureContext]
  partial interface Navigator {
    [SameObject]
    readonly attribute Bluetooth bluetooth;
  };
</xmp>

# Integrations # {#integrations}

## Permissions Policy ## {#permissions-policy}

This specification defines a <a>policy-controlled feature</a>, identified by
the token "<dfn data-dfn-for="policy-controlled feature"><code>bluetooth</code></dfn>",
that controls whether the methods exposed by the {{Navigator/bluetooth}}
attribute on the {{Navigator}} object may be used.

The <a>default allowlist</a> for this feature is <code>["self"]</code>.

# Terminology and Conventions # {#terminology}

  This specification uses a few conventions and several terms from other
  specifications. This section lists those and links to their primary
  definitions.

When an algorithm in this specification uses a name defined in this or another
specification, the name MUST resolve to its initial value, ignoring any changes
that have been made to the name in the current execution environment. For
example, when the {{Bluetooth/requestDevice()}} algorithm says to call
<code>{{Array.prototype.map}}.call(<var>filter</var>.services,
  {{BluetoothUUID/getService()|BluetoothUUID.getService}})</code>,
this MUST apply the {{Array.prototype.map}} algorithm defined in [[ECMAScript]]
with <code><var>filter</var>.services</code> as its <code>this</code> parameter
and the algorithm defined in <a href="#standardized-uuids"></a> for
{{BluetoothUUID/getService()|BluetoothUUID.getService}} as its
<code>callbackfn</code> parameter, regardless of any modifications that have
been made to <code>window</code>, <code>Array</code>,
<code>Array.prototype</code>, <code>Array.prototype.map</code>,
<code>Function</code>, <code>Function.prototype</code>,
<code>BluetoothUUID</code>, <code>BluetoothUUID.getService</code>, or other
objects.

This specification uses a read-only type that is similar to WebIDL's
{{FrozenArray}}.

* A <dfn>read only ArrayBuffer</dfn> has {{ArrayBuffer}}'s values and interface,
    except that attempting to write to its contents or transfer it has the same
    effect as trying to write to a {{FrozenArray}}'s contents. This applies to
    {{TypedArray}}s and {{DataView}}s wrapped around the {{ArrayBuffer}} too.
