# Contribution mechanics

When sending a pull request that changes a `.bs` file,
please include a preview URL of the form
`https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/?url=https://github.com/{org}/web-bluetooth/raw/{branch}/{spec}.bs`.

You can iterate locally by
[installing Bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed/blob/master/docs/install.md)
and then running `bikeshed watch {spec}.bs`,
where `{spec}` is either `index` or `scanning`.
If you've installed Bikeshed locally,
then each time you start editing the spec you should
update it using the instructions at the bottom of that link.
