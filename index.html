      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://developer.bluetooth.org/">Bluetooth</a> is
        a standard for short-range wireless communication between devices.
        Bluetooth "Classic" (<abbr title="Basic Rate">BR</abbr>/<abbr title="Enhanced Data Rate">EDR</abbr>)
        defines a set of binary protocols and supports speeds up to about 24Mbps.
        Bluetooth 4.0 introduced a new "Low Energy" mode known as "Smart",
        <abbr title="Bluetooth Low Energy">BTLE</abbr>, or just <abbr title="Low Energy">LE</abbr>
        which is limited to about 1Mbps but
        allows devices to leave their transmitters off most of the time.
        BTLE provides most of its functionality through key/value pairs provided by
        the <a title="Generic Attribute Profile">Generic Attribute Profile
        (<abbr title="Generic Attribute Profile">GATT</abbr>)</a>.

      <p>
        BTLE defines multiple roles that devices can play.
        The <dfn>Broadcaster</dfn> and <dfn>Observer</dfn> roles are
        for transmitter- and receiver-only applications, respectively.
        The <dfn>Peripheral</dfn> role is able to receive a single connection.
        The <dfn>Central</dfn> role supports multiple connections,
        and is responsible for creating any connections to <a>Peripheral</a> devices.

      <p>
        <dfn>GATT</dfn> further defines <dfn>Client</dfn> and <dfn>Server</dfn> roles,
        which are orthogonal to the <a>Peripheral</a> and <a>Central</a> BTLE roles.
        GATT allows <a>Server</a>s to expose <a>Service</a>s, whose type is identified by
        a <abbr title="Universally Unique Identifier">UUID</abbr> ([[!RFC4122]]).
        A <dfn>Service</dfn> exposes a collection of included Services and Characteristics.
        Each <dfn>Characteristic</dfn> has a type named by a UUID and
        exposes a value as an array of bytes,
        some properties to describe how the value can be used, and a collection of Descriptors.
        Each <dfn>Descriptor</dfn> has a type named by a UUID and
        contains related information about the Characteristic Value.

      <p>
        Despite being designed to support BTLE transport,
        the GATT protocol can also run over BR/EDR transport.
        Both support advertising GATT services without a connection:
        BTLE through advertising packets, and BR/EDR through the extended inquiry response.

      <p>
        The first version of this specification focuses on the Bluetooth 4 GATT protocol
        in the <a>Central</a> and <a>Client</a> roles, over either a BR/EDR or LE connection.
        While this specification cites the [[BLUETOOTH41]] specification,
        it intends to also support communication with devices that only implement Bluetooth 4.0.

      <h2>Security and privacy considerations</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>Device access is powerful</h2>

        <p>
          When a website requests access to devices using
          <code><a href="#widl-BluetoothDiscovery-requestDevice-Promise-BluetoothDevice--sequence-BluetoothScanFilter--filters">requestDevice</a></code>,
          it gets the ability to access all GATT services mentioned in the call.
          The UA MUST inform the user what capabilities these services give the website
          before asking which devices to entrust to it.
          If any services in the list aren't known to the UA,
          the UA MUST assume they give the site complete control over the device
          and inform the user of this risk.
          The UA MUST also allow the user to inspect what sites have access to what devices
          and revoke these pairings.

        <p>
          The UA MUST NOT allow the user to pair entire classes of devices with a website.
          It is possible to construct a class of devices
          for which each individual device sends the same Bluetooth-level identifying information.
          UAs are not required to attempt to detect this sort of forgery
          and MAY let a user pair this pseudo-device with a website.

        <p>
          To help ensure that only the entity the user approved for access actually has access,
          this specification requires that only
          <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/mixedcontent/#authenticated-environment">authenticated environments</a>
          can access Bluetooth devices
          (<a href="#requestDevice-authenticated-environment">requestDevice</a>).
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h2>Attacks on devices</h2>

        <p>
          We expect that many devices are vulnerable to unexpected data delivered to their radio.
          In the past, these devices had to be exploited one-by-one,
          but this API makes it plausible to conduct large-scale attacks.
          This specification takes several approaches to make such attacks more difficult:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Pairing individual devices instead of device classes
            requires at least a user action before a device can be exploited.

          <li>
            Constraining access to <a>GATT</a>, as opposed to generic byte-stream access,
            denies malicious websites access to most parsers on the device.

            <p>
              On the other hand,
              GATT's <a>Characteristic</a> and <a>Descriptor</a> values are still byte arrays,
              which may be set to lengths and formats the device doesn't expect.
              UAs are encouraged to validate these values when they can.

          <li>
            This API never exposes Bluetooth addressing, data signing or encryption keys ([[!BLUETOOTH41]] Volume 3 Part H Section 2.4.1) to websites.
            This makes it more difficult for a website to predict the bits that will be sent over the radio,
            which blocks <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/woot11/tech/final_files/Goodspeed.pdf">packet-in-packet injection attacks</a>.
            Unfortunately, this only works over encrypted links,
            which not all BTLE devices are required to support.
        </ul>

        <p>
          UAs can also take further steps to protect their users:

        <ul>
          <li>
            A web service may collect lists of malicious websites and vulnerable devices.
            UAs can deny malicious websites access to any device
            and any website access to vulnerable devices.
        </ul>

        <h2>Bluetooth device identifiers</h2>

        <p>
          Each Bluetooth BR/EDR device has a unique 48-bit MAC address
          known as the <dfn>BD_ADDR</dfn> ([[!BLUETOOTH41]] 3.C.15).
          Each Bluetooth LE device has at least one of a <a>Public Device Address</a>
          and a <a>Static Random Address</a>.
          The <dfn>Public Device Address</dfn> is a MAC address ([[!BLUETOOTH41]] 6.B.1.3).
          The <dfn>Static Random Address</dfn> may be regenerated
          on each restart ([[!BLUETOOTH41]] 3.C.10.8).
          A BR/EDR/LE device will use the same value
          for the <a>BD_ADDR</a> and the <a>Public Device Address</a> ([[!BLUETOOTH41]] 2.E.7.4.6).

        <p>
          An LE device may also have a unique, 128-bit
          <dfn title="Identity Resolving Key">Identity Resolving Key
          (<abbr title="Identity Resolving Key">IRK</abbr>)</dfn>
          ([[!BLUETOOTH41]] 3.H.2.4.2.1),
          which is sent to trusted devices during the bonding process.
          To avoid leaking a persistent identifier, an LE device may scan and advertise using
          a random <dfn>Resolvable Private Address</dfn> or <dfn>Non-Resolvable Private Address</dfn>
          instead of its Static or Public Address.
          These are regenerated periodically (approximately every 15 minutes),
          but a bonded device can check whether one of its stored <a>IRK</a>s matches
          any given Resolvable Private Address ([[!BLUETOOTH41]] 3.C.10.8.2.3).

        <p>
          Each Bluetooth device also has a human-readable <dfn>Device Name</dfn>
          (([[!BLUETOOTH41]] 3.C.3.2.2).
          These aren't guaranteed to be unique, but may well be, depending on the device type.

        <section class="informative">
          <h2>Identifiers for remote Bluetooth devices</h2>

          <p>
            If a website can retrieve any of the persistent device IDs,
            these can be used, in combination with a large effort to catalog ambient devices,
            to discover a user's location.
            A device ID can also be used to identify that a user who
            pairs two different websites with the same Bluetooth device
            is a single user.
            On the other hand, many GATT services are available
            that could be used to fingerprint a device,
            and a device can easily expose a custom GATT service to make this easier.

          <p>
            Because it would be so easy to work around an attempt to block device identification,
            this spec doesn't try to do so.

          <h2>The UA's Bluetooth address</h2>

          <p>
            In BR/EDR mode, or in LE mode during active scanning without the <a>Privacy Feature</a>,
            the UA broadcasts its persistent ID to any nearby Bluetooth radio.
            This makes it easy to scatter hostile devices in an area and track the UA.
            As of 2014-08, few or no platforms document that they implement the <a>Privacy Feature</a>,
            so despite this spec recommending it, few UAs are likely to use it.
            This spec does <a href="#requestDevice-user-gesture">require a user gesture</a>
            for a website to trigger a scan, which reduces the frequency of scans some,
            but it would still be better for more platforms to expose the <a>Privacy Feature</a>.
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Device Discovery</h2>

      <p>
        The UA MUST maintain an <dfn>allowed devices list</dfn> for each origin,
        storing a set of Bluetooth devices the origin is allowed to access.
        For each device in the <a>allowed devices list</a> for an origin,
        the UA MUST maintain an <dfn>allowed services list</dfn> consisting of
        UUIDs for GATT Primary <a>Service</a>s the origin is allowed to access on the device.
        The UA MAY remove devices from the <a>allowed devices list</a> at any time
        based on signals from the user.
        For example, if the user chooses not to remember access,
        the UA might remove a device when the tab that was granted access to it is closed.
        Or the UA might provide a revocation UI that allows the user
        to explicitly remove a device even while a tab is actively using that device.
        If a device is removed from this list while
        a <a>Promise</a> is pending to do something with the device,
        it MUST be treated the same as if the device moved out of Bluetooth range.

      <dl title="[NoInterfaceObject] interface BluetoothDiscovery" class="idl" data-merge="BluetoothScanFilter RequestDeviceOptions">
        <dt>Promise&lt;BluetoothDevice> requestDevice(sequence&lt;BluetoothScanFilter> filters, optional RequestDeviceOptions options)</dt>
        <dd>
          When this method is invoked, the UA MUST run the following steps:
          <ol>
            <li>Return a new <a>Promise</a>, but continue running these steps asynchronously.</li>
            <li id="requestDevice-authenticated-environment">

              reject the <a>Promise</a> with a <a>SecurityError</a> and abort these steps.

            <li>
              Display a prompt to the user requesting that the user specify some devices from the result of the scan.
              The UA SHOULD show the user the human-readable name of each device.
              If this name is not available because the UA's Bluetooth system doesn't support privacy-enabled scans,
              the UA SHOULD allow the user to indicate interest and then perform a privacy-disabled scan to retrieve the name.
              <p>
              The UA MAY allow the user to select a nearby device that does not match <var>filters</var>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wait for the user to have made their selection.

            <li>
              If the user cancels the prompt, reject the Promise with a <a>NotFoundError</a> and abort these steps.

            <li>
              Record the selected device in the origin's <a>allowed devices list</a>

        that device might not be included in the list of devices presented to the user.
        The UA would need to connect to the device to discover the full list of supported services,

                  Connecting to every nearby device to discover services costs power and

                  UAs should only discover extra services on a device if
                  they have some reason to expect that device to be interesting.

                <p>
                  UAs should also help developers avoid relying on this extra discovery behavior.
                  For example, say a developer has previously connected to a device,
                  so the UA knows the device's full set of supported services.
                  If this developer then filters using a non-advertised UUID,
                  the dialog they see may include this device,
                  even if the filter would likely exclude the device on users' machines.
                  The UA could provide a developer option to warn when this happens or
                  to include only advertised services in matching filters.

          For each known GATT <a>Characteristic</a>, the UA MUST maintain

          This is a single set for the whole UA,
          pointing to the <a href="#widl-NavigatorBluetooth-bluetooth"><code>navigator.bluetooth</code></a> object
          for each separate script execution environment that has registered for notifications.

        <p>

            is set, matching the constraints in <var>characteristic</var>'s properties.
            The UA SHOULD avoid setting both bits,

        <h2>Error handling</h2>

        <p class="note">
          This section primarily defines the mapping from system errors to Javascript error names
          and allows UAs to retry certain operations.
          The retry logic and possible error distinctions
          are highly constrained by the operating system,
          so places these requirements don't reflect reality
          are likely spec bugs instead of browser bugs.

        <p>
          When a step in an algorithm that uses a Bluetooth GATT procedure ([[!BLUETOOTH41]] 3.G.4)
          says to "<dfn>Use the Bluetooth error recovery procedure</dfn>" with a promise,
          the UA MUST perform the following steps:

        <ol>
          <li>
            If the Bluetooth procedure completes with anything other than
            an <code>Error Response</code> ([[!BLUETOOTH41]] 3.F.3.4.1.1),
            the recovery procedure succeeds.
            Abort these steps.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the procedure times out ([[!BLUETOOTH41]] 3.G.4.14) or
            the ATT Bearer ([[!BLUETOOTH41]] 3.G.2.4) is terminated for any reason,
            reject the promise with a <a>NetworkError</a> and abort these steps.
            The recovery procedure fails.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take the following actions depending on the <code>Error Code</code>:
            <dl>
              <dt><code>Invalid Handle</code></dt>
              <dt><code>Invalid PDU</code></dt>
              <dt><code>Invalid Offset</code></dt>
              <dt><code>Attribute Not Found</code></dt>
              <dt><code>Unsupported Group Type</code></dt>
              <dd>
                These error codes indicate that something unexpected happened at the protocol layer,
                likely either due to a UA or device bug.
                Reject the promise with a <a>NotSupportedError</a>.
                The recovery procedure fails.
              </dd>

              <dt><code>Invalid Attribute Value Length</code></dt>
              <dd>
                Reject the promise with an <a>InvalidModificationError</a>.
                The recovery procedure fails.
              </dd>

              <dt><code>Attribute Not Long</code></dt>
              <dd>
                If this error code is received without having used a "Long" sub-procedure,
                this may indicate a device bug.
                Reject the promise with a <a>NotSupportedError</a>,
                and the recovery procedure fails.

                <p>
                  Otherwise, retry the GATT procedure without using a "Long" sub-procedure.
                  If this is impossible due to the length of the value being written,
                  reject the promise with an <a>InvalidModificationError</a>,
                  and the recovery procedure fails.
              </dd>

              <dt><code>Insufficient Encryption</code></dt>
              <dt><code>Insufficient Encryption Key Size</code></dt>
              <dd>
                The UA SHOULD attempt to increase the security level of the connection.
                If this attempt fails or the UA doesn't support any higher security,
                reject the promise with a <a>SecurityError</a>,
                and the recovery procedure fails.
                Otherwise, retry the GATT procedure at the new higher security level.

              <dt><code>Insufficient Authorization</code></dt>
              <dd>
                Reject the promise with a <a>SecurityError</a>,

      <h2>UUIDs</h2>

      <div title="typedef DOMString UUID" class="idl">
        <p>
          A <a>UUID</a> string represents a 128-bit [[!RFC4122]] UUID.
          A <dfn>valid UUID</dfn> is a string that matches
          the [[!ECMAScript]] regexp
          <code>/^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/</code>.
          That is, a <a>valid UUID</a> is lower-case and
          does not use the 16- or 32-bit abbreviations defined by the Bluetooth standard.
          All UUIDs returned from functions and attributes in this specification
          MUST be <a>valid UUID</a>s.
          If a function in this specification takes a parameter whose type is <a>UUID</a>
          or a dictionary including a <a>UUID</a> attribute,
          and the argument passed in any <a>UUID</a> slot is not a <a>valid UUID</a>,
          the function MUST return a <a>Promise</a> rejected with a <code>TypeError</code>
          and abort its other steps.

        <p class="note">
          This standard provides the
          <a href="#widl-BluetoothUuids-canonicalUUID-UUID-unsigned-long-alias"><code>canonicalUUID()</code></a> function
          to map a 16- or 32-bit Bluetooth UUID alias to its 128-bit form.

        <p class="note">
          Bluetooth devices are required to convert 16- and 32-bit UUIDs to 128-bit UUIDs
          before comparing them ([[BLUETOOTH41]] 3.F.3.2.1), but not all devices do so.
          To interoperate with these devices,
          if the UA has received a UUID from the device in one form (16-, 32-, or 128-bit),
          it should send other aliases of that UUID back to the device in the same form.

      <h2>Standardized identifiers</h2>

      <p>
        The Bluetooth standard defines numbers that identify services, characteristics, descriptors, and other entities.
        This section provides javascript names for these constants so they don't need to be replicated in each application.

        <dd>
          Returns a 128-bit <a>UUID</a> given a 16- or 32-bit Bluetooth UUID alias.
          The algorithm for converting an alias to a full 128-bit UUID is defined in [[!BLUETOOTH41]] Volume 3 Part B Section 2.5.1:
          the top 32 bits of "<code>00000000-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb</code>" are replaced by the bits of the alias.
          For example, <code>canonicalUUID(0xDEADBEEF)</code> returns <code>"deadbeef-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb"</code>.
