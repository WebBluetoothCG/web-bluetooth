    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://developer.bluetooth.org/">Bluetooth</a> is
        a standard for short-range wireless communication between devices.
        Bluetooth "Classic" (<abbr title="Basic Rate">BR</abbr>/<abbr title="Enhanced Data Rate">EDR</abbr>)
        defines a set of binary protocols and supports speeds up to about 24Mbps.
        Bluetooth 4.0 introduced a new "Low Energy" mode known as "Smart",
        <abbr title="Bluetooth Low Energy">BTLE</abbr>, or just <abbr title="Low Energy">LE</abbr>
        which is limited to about 1Mbps but
        allows devices to leave their transmitters off most of the time.
        BTLE provides most of its functionality through key/value pairs provided by
        the <a title="Generic Attribute Profile">Generic Attribute Profile
        (<abbr title="Generic Attribute Profile">GATT</abbr>)</a>.

      <p>
        BTLE defines multiple roles that devices can play.
        The <dfn>Broadcaster</dfn> and <dfn>Observer</dfn> roles are
        for transmitter- and receiver-only applications, respectively.
        The <dfn>Peripheral</dfn> role is able to receive a single connection.
        The <dfn>Central</dfn> role supports multiple connections,
        and is responsible for creating any connections to <a>Peripheral</a> devices.

      <p>
        <dfn>GATT</dfn> further defines <dfn>Client</dfn> and <dfn>Server</dfn> roles,
        which are orthogonal to the <a>Peripheral</a> and <a>Central</a> BTLE roles.
        GATT allows <a>Server</a>s to expose <a>Service</a>s, whose type is identified by
        a <abbr title="Universally Unique Identifier">UUID</abbr> ([[!RFC4122]]).
        A <dfn>Service</dfn> exposes a collection of included Services and Characteristics.
        Each <dfn>Characteristic</dfn> has a type named by a UUID and
        exposes a value as an array of bytes,
        some properties to describe how the value can be used, and a collection of Descriptors.
        Each <dfn>Descriptor</dfn> has a type named by a UUID and
        contains related information about the Characteristic Value.

      <p>
        Despite being designed to support BTLE transport,
        the GATT protocol can also run over BR/EDR transport.
        Both support advertising GATT services without a connection:
        BTLE through advertising packets, and BR/EDR through the extended inquiry response.

      <p>
        The first version of this specification focuses on the Bluetooth 4 GATT protocol
        in the <a>Central</a> and <a>Client</a> roles, over either a BR/EDR or LE connection.
        While this specification cites the [[BLUETOOTH41]] specification,
        it intends to also support communication with devices that only implement Bluetooth 4.0.

      <h2>Security and privacy considerations</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>Device access is powerful</h2>

        <p>
          When a website requests access to devices using
          <code><a href="#widl-BluetoothDiscovery-requestDevice-Promise-BluetoothDevice--sequence-BluetoothScanFilter--filters">requestDevice</a></code>,
          it gets the ability to access all GATT services mentioned in the call.
          The UA MUST inform the user what capabilities these services give the website
          before asking which devices to entrust to it.
          If any services in the list aren't known to the UA,
          the UA MUST assume they give the site complete control over the device
          and inform the user of this risk.
          The UA MUST also allow the user to inspect what sites have access to what devices
          and revoke these pairings.

        <p>
          The UA MUST NOT allow the user to pair entire classes of devices with a website.
          It is possible to construct a class of devices
          for which each individual device sends the same Bluetooth-level identifying information.
          UAs are not required to attempt to detect this sort of forgery
          and MAY let a user pair this pseudo-device with a website.

        <p>
          To help ensure that only the entity the user approved for access actually has access,
          this specification requires that only <a>sufficiently secure context</a>s
          can access Bluetooth devices
          (<a href="#requestDevice-secure-context">requestDevice</a>).
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h2>Attacks on devices</h2>

        <p>
          We expect that many devices are vulnerable to unexpected data delivered to their radio.
          In the past, these devices had to be exploited one-by-one,
          but this API makes it plausible to conduct large-scale attacks.
          This specification takes several approaches to make such attacks more difficult:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Pairing individual devices instead of device classes
            requires at least a user action before a device can be exploited.

          <li>
            Constraining access to <a>GATT</a>, as opposed to generic byte-stream access,
            denies malicious websites access to most parsers on the device.

            <p>
              On the other hand,
              GATT's <a>Characteristic</a> and <a>Descriptor</a> values are still byte arrays,
              which may be set to lengths and formats the device doesn't expect.
              UAs are encouraged to validate these values when they can.

          <li>
            This API never exposes Bluetooth addressing, data signing or encryption keys ([[!BLUETOOTH41]] Volume 3 Part H Section 2.4.1) to websites.
            This makes it more difficult for a website to predict the bits that will be sent over the radio,
            which blocks <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/woot11/tech/final_files/Goodspeed.pdf">packet-in-packet injection attacks</a>.
            Unfortunately, this only works over encrypted links,
            which not all BTLE devices are required to support.
        </ul>

        <p>
          UAs can also take further steps to protect their users:

        <ul>
          <li>
            A web service may collect lists of malicious websites and vulnerable devices.
            UAs can deny malicious websites access to any device
            and any website access to vulnerable devices.
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h2>Bluetooth device identifiers</h2>

        <p>
          Each Bluetooth BR/EDR device has a unique 48-bit MAC address
          known as the <dfn>BD_ADDR</dfn> ([[!BLUETOOTH41]] 3.C.15).
          Each Bluetooth LE device has at least one of a <a>Public Device Address</a>
          and a <a>Static Random Address</a>.
          The <dfn>Public Device Address</dfn> is a MAC address ([[!BLUETOOTH41]] 6.B.1.3).
          The <dfn>Static Random Address</dfn> may be regenerated
          on each restart ([[!BLUETOOTH41]] 3.C.10.8).
          A BR/EDR/LE device will use the same value
          for the <a>BD_ADDR</a> and the <a>Public Device Address</a> ([[!BLUETOOTH41]] 2.E.7.4.6).

        <p>
          An LE device may also have a unique, 128-bit <a>Identity Resolving Key</a>,
          which is sent to trusted devices during the bonding process.
          To avoid leaking a persistent identifier, an LE device may scan and advertise using
          a random <dfn>Resolvable Private Address</dfn> or <dfn>Non-Resolvable Private Address</dfn>
          instead of its Static or Public Address.
          These are regenerated periodically (approximately every 15 minutes),
          but a bonded device can check whether one of its stored <a>IRK</a>s matches
          any given Resolvable Private Address ([[!BLUETOOTH41]] 3.C.10.8.2.3).

        <p>
          Each Bluetooth device also has a human-readable <dfn>Device Name</dfn>
          (([[!BLUETOOTH41]] 3.C.3.2.2).
          These aren't guaranteed to be unique, but may well be, depending on the device type.

        <section class="informative">
          <h2>Identifiers for remote Bluetooth devices</h2>

          <p>
            If a website can retrieve any of the persistent device IDs,
            these can be used, in combination with a large effort to catalog ambient devices,
            to discover a user's location.
            A device ID can also be used to identify that a user who
            pairs two different websites with the same Bluetooth device
            is a single user.
            On the other hand, many GATT services are available
            that could be used to fingerprint a device,
            and a device can easily expose a custom GATT service to make this easier.

          <p>
            Because it would be so easy to work around an attempt to block device identification,
            this spec doesn't try to do so.

          <h2>The UA's Bluetooth address</h2>

          <p>
            In BR/EDR mode, or in LE mode during active scanning without the <a>Privacy Feature</a>,
            the UA broadcasts its persistent ID to any nearby Bluetooth radio.
            This makes it easy to scatter hostile devices in an area and track the UA.
            As of 2014-08, few or no platforms document that they implement the <a>Privacy Feature</a>,
            so despite this spec recommending it, few UAs are likely to use it.
            This spec does <a href="#requestDevice-user-gesture">require a user gesture</a>
            for a website to trigger a scan, which reduces the frequency of scans some,
            but it would still be better for more platforms to expose the <a>Privacy Feature</a>.

              Display a prompt to the user requesting that the user specify some devices from the result of the scan.
              The UA SHOULD show the user the human-readable name of each device.
              If this name is not available because the UA's Bluetooth system doesn't support privacy-enabled scans,
              the UA SHOULD allow the user to indicate interest and then perform a privacy-disabled scan to retrieve the name.
              <p>
              The UA MAY allow the user to select a nearby device that does not match <var>filters</var>.

      <p class="note">
        The list of Service UUIDs that a device advertises
        might not include all the UUIDs the device supports.
        The advertising data does specify whether this list is complete.
        If a website filters for a UUID that a nearby device supports but doesn't advertise,
        that device might not be included in the list of devices presented to the user.
        The UA would need to connect to the device to discover the full list of supported services,
        which can impair radio performance and cause delays, so this spec doesn't require it.

                  UAs should only discover extra services on a device if

                <p>
                  UAs should also help developers avoid relying on this extra discovery behavior.
                  For example, say a developer has previously connected to a device,
                  so the UA knows the device's full set of supported services.
                  If this developer then filters using a non-advertised UUID,
                  the dialog they see may include this device,
                  even if the filter would likely exclude the device on users' machines.
                  The UA could provide a developer option to warn when this happens or

        <p>
          The physical Bluetooth device may be guaranteed to have
          some properties that the UA may not have received.
          Those properties are described as optional here.
        </p>

        <p>
          A <dfn>Bluetooth device</dfn> has the following properties.
          Optional properties are not present, and sequence and map properties are empty,
          unless/until described otherwise.
          Other properties have a default specified or are specified when a device is introduced.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            One or more of several kinds of 48-bit address:
            a <a>Public Bluetooth Address</a>, a (random) <a>Static Address</a>,
            and a resolvable or non-resolvable <a>Private Address</a>.
          </li>
          <li>An optional 128-bit <a>Identity Resolving Key</a>.</li>

          <li>
            An optional partial or complete <a>Bluetooth Device Name</a>.
            A device has a partial name when the <a>Shortened Local Name</a> AD data was received,
            but the full name hasn't been read yet.
          </li>

          <li>
            An <dfn>LE-connected flag</dfn>,
            indicating whether the device is connected to the UA over the LE physical transport.
            This flag is initially false.
            The <a>Connection Modes and Procedures</a> create and destroy LE connections.
          </li>

          <li>
            A <dfn>bonded flag</dfn>, indicating whether the Bluetooth device is bonded to the UA.
            Devices bond using the <a>Bonding Procedure</a>.
            <p class="note">
              The Bluetooth standard uses "pairing" to refer to
              creating and exchanging a shared secret,
              and "bonding" to refer to storing that secret for use in subsequent connections.
              Platform APIs don't give independent control of the two processes,
              and they present the combined process to users under the label "pairing",
              so this specification uses "pairing" and "bonding" interchangeably

            one of the values defined in [[!BLUETOOTH-ASSIGNED-BASEBAND]].
            The Class of Device is only used over the BR/EDR physical transport, not LE.
          </li>

            A hierarchy of GATT attributes, described in <a href="#information-model"></a>.

      <h2>GATT Interaction</h2>

      <section id="information-model">
        <h2>GATT Information Model</h2>

        <p class="note">
          The <a>GATT Profile Hierarchy</a> describes how any device that supports <a>GATT</a>
          can contain a hierarchy of Profiles, Primary Services, Included Services,
          Characteristics, and Descriptors.
          Profiles are purely logical:
          the specification of a Profile describes the expected interactions between
          the other GATT entities the Profile contains,
          but it's impossible to query which Profiles a device supports.
          On the other hand,
          GATT defines a set of <a title="GATT procedures">procedures</a> to
          discover and interact with the Services, Characteristics, and Descriptors on a device.
          GATT also defines the <a>Service Changed</a> characteristic to allow clients
          to cache the Services, Characteristics, and Descriptors they have discovered on a device.
          Services, Characteristics, and Descriptors
          can be ordered by their <a>Attribute Handle</a>,
          but while platform interfaces provide these entities in an order,
          they do not guarantee that it's consistent with the <a>Attribute Handle</a> order.
        </p>

        <p>
          The UA MUST maintain a <dfn>Bluetooth cache</dfn>
          of the hierarchy of Services, Characteristics, and Descriptors
          it has discovered on a device.
          The UA MAY share this cache between multiple origins accessing the same device.
          Each potential entity in the cache is either known-present, known-absent, or unknown.
          Each known-present entity in the cache is associated with an optional
          <code>Promise&lt;<a>BluetoothGATTService</a>></code>,
          <code>Promise&lt;<a>BluetoothGATTCharacteristic</a>></code>,
          or <code>Promise&lt;<a>BluetoothGATTDescriptor</a>></code> instance
          for each <a>script execution environment</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          For example, if a user calls the <code>serviceA.getCharacteristic(uuid1)</code> function
          with an initially empty <a>Bluetooth cache</a>,
          the UA uses the <a>Discover Characteristics by UUID</a> procedure
          to fill the needed cache entries,
          and the UA ends the procedure early because
          it only needs one Characteristic to fulfil the returned <a>Promise</a>,
          then the first Characteristic with UUID <code>uuid1</code> inside <code>serviceA</code>
          is known-present,
          and any subsequent Characteristics with that UUID remain unknown.
          If the user later calls <code>serviceA.getCharacteristics(uuid1)</code>,
          the UA needs to resume or restart the <a>Discover Characteristics by UUID</a> procedure.
          If it turns out that
          <code>serviceA</code> only has one Characteristic with UUID <code>uuid1</code>,
          then the subsequent Characteristics become known-absent.
        </p>

        <p>
          The known-present entries in the <a>Bluetooth cache</a> are ordered:
          Primary Services appear in a particular order within a device,
          Included Services and Characteristics appear in a particular order within Services,
          and Descriptors appear in a particular order within Characteristics.
          The order SHOULD match the order of <a>Attribute Handle</a>s on the device,
          but UAs MAY use another order if the device's order isn't available.
        </p>

        <p>
          To <dfn>populate the Bluetooth cache</dfn> with entries matching some description,
          the UA MUST run the following steps.
          <span class="note">Note that these steps can block,
            so uses of this algorithm must be <a>in parallel</a>.</span>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Attempt to make all matching entries in the cache either known-present or known-absent,
            using any sequence of <a>GATT procedures</a> that [[BLUETOOTH41]] specifies
            will return enough information.

          </li>
          <li>
            If the previous step returns an error, return that error from this algorithm.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          To <dfn>query the Bluetooth cache</dfn> for entries matching some description,
          the UA MUST return <a>a new promise</a> <var>promise</var>
          and run the following steps <a>in parallel</a>:

          </li>
          <li>
            Let <var>entries</var> be the sequence
            of known-present cache entries matching the description.

          <li>
            Let <var>result</var> be a new sequence.
          </li>
          <li>

              <li>
                If <var>entry</var> has no associated <code>BluetoothGATT*</code> instance

          <h2>Identifying Services, Characteristics, and Descriptors</h2>

          <p>
            When checking whether two Services, Characteristics, or Descriptors
            <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are the <dfn>same attribute</dfn>,
            the UA SHOULD determine that they are the same if <var>a</var> and <var>b</var>
            are inside the <a>same device</a> and have the same <a>Attribute Handle</a>,
            but MAY use any algorithm it wants with the constraint that
            <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> MUST NOT be considered the <a>same attribute</a> if
            they fit any of the following conditions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>They are not both Services, both Characteristics, or both Descriptors.</li>
            <li>They are both Services, but are not both primary or both secondary services.</li>
            <li>They have different UUIDs.</li>
            <li>
              Their parent Devices aren't the <a>same device</a> or
              their parent Services or Characteristics aren't the <a>same attribute</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="note">
            This definition is loose because platform APIs expose their own notion of identity
            without documenting whether it's based on <a>Attribute Handle</a> equality.
          </p>

          <p>
            For each origin, the UA must maintain an <dfn>attribute instance id map</dfn>
            mapping Services, Characteristics, and Descriptors to <code>DOMString</code>s.

          <ol>
            <li>
              If <var>attribute</var> is the <a>same attribute</a> as

            Before discovering any of these entities for the purpose of exposing them to a web page

            <li>

              and <a>Characteristic Descriptor Discovery</a> procedures
              to re-discover entities in the range indicated by the Service Changed characteristic.
              The UA MAY skip discovering all or part of the indicated range
              if it can prove that the results of that discovery
              could not affect the events fired below.

        <h2>Error handling</h2>

        <p class="note">
          This section primarily defines the mapping from system errors to Javascript error names
          and allows UAs to retry certain operations.
          The retry logic and possible error distinctions
          are highly constrained by the operating system,
          so places these requirements don't reflect reality
          are likely <a href="https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/issues">spec bugs</a>
          instead of browser bugs.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the UA is using a <a title="GATT procedures">GATT procedure</a>
          to execute a step in an algorithm or to handle a query to the <a>Bluetooth cache</a>
          (both referred to as a "step", here),
          and the GATT procedure returns an <code><a>Error Response</a></code>,
          the UA MUST perform the following steps:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            If the <a title="Procedure timeouts">procedure times out</a> or
            the ATT Bearer (described in <a>Profile Fundamentals</a>) is terminated for any reason,
            return a <a>NetworkError</a> from the step and abort these steps.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take the following actions depending on the <code>Error Code</code>:
            <dl>
              <dt><code>Invalid Handle</code></dt>
              <dt><code>Invalid PDU</code></dt>
              <dt><code>Invalid Offset</code></dt>
              <dt><code>Attribute Not Found</code></dt>
              <dt><code>Unsupported Group Type</code></dt>
              <dd>
                These error codes indicate that something unexpected happened at the protocol layer,
                likely either due to a UA or device bug.
                Return a <a>NotSupportedError</a> from the step.
              </dd>

              <dt><code>Invalid Attribute Value Length</code></dt>
              <dd>
                Return an <a>InvalidModificationError</a> from the step.
              </dd>

              <dt><code>Attribute Not Long</code></dt>
              <dd>
                <p>
                  If this error code is received without having used a "Long" sub-procedure,
                  this may indicate a device bug.
                  Return a <a>NotSupportedError</a> from the step.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Otherwise, retry the step without using a "Long" sub-procedure.
                  If this is impossible due to the length of the value being written,
                  return an <a>InvalidModificationError</a> from the step.

              <dd>
                The UA SHOULD attempt to increase the security level of the connection.
                If this attempt fails or the UA doesn't support any higher security,
                Return a <a>SecurityError</a> from the step.
                Otherwise, retry the step at the new higher security level.

      <h2>UUIDs</h2>

      <div title="typedef DOMString UUID" class="idl">
        <p>
          A <a>UUID</a> string represents a 128-bit [[!RFC4122]] UUID.
          A <dfn>valid UUID</dfn> is a string that matches
          the [[!ECMAScript]] regexp
          <code>/^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/</code>.
          That is, a <a>valid UUID</a> is lower-case and
          does not use the 16- or 32-bit abbreviations defined by the Bluetooth standard.
          All UUIDs returned from functions and attributes in this specification
          MUST be <a>valid UUID</a>s.
          If a function in this specification takes a parameter whose type is <a>UUID</a>
          or a dictionary including a <a>UUID</a> attribute,
          and the argument passed in any <a>UUID</a> slot is not a <a>valid UUID</a>,
          the function MUST return <a>a promise rejected with</a> a <code>TypeError</code>
          and abort its other steps.

        <p class="note">
          This standard provides the
          <a href="#widl-BluetoothUuids-canonicalUUID-UUID-unsigned-long-alias"><code>canonicalUUID()</code></a> function
          to map a 16- or 32-bit Bluetooth UUID alias to its 128-bit form.

        <p class="note">
          Bluetooth devices are required to convert 16- and 32-bit UUIDs to 128-bit UUIDs
          before comparing them (as described in <a>Attribute Type</a>), but not all devices do so.
          To interoperate with these devices,
          if the UA has received a UUID from the device in one form (16-, 32-, or 128-bit),
          it should send other aliases of that UUID back to the device in the same form.

      <h2>Standardized identifiers</h2>

      <p>
        The Bluetooth standard defines numbers that identify services, characteristics, descriptors, and other entities.
        This section provides javascript names for these constants so they don't need to be replicated in each application.

        <dd>
          Returns a 128-bit <a>UUID</a> given a 16- or 32-bit Bluetooth <a title="UUID aliases">UUID alias</a>.
          The algorithm for converting an alias to a full 128-bit UUID is defined in [[!BLUETOOTH41]] 3.F.3.2.1:
          the top 32 bits of "<code>00000000-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb</code>" are replaced by the bits of the alias.
          For example, <code>canonicalUUID(0xDEADBEEF)</code> returns <code>"deadbeef-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb"</code>.
